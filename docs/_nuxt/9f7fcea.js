Invasion that makes it more and more toxic every day. Now it is only a matter of time before the Russian army with its own actions and war crimes forces everyone in the world to renounce all ties with the Russian Federation.\n\nSecurity work is underway in the northern regions of our country, from where the occupiers were expelled. First of all, it is mine clearance. Russian troops left behind tens if not hundreds of thousands of dangerous objects. These are shells that did not explode, mines, tripwire mines. At least several thousand such items are disposed of daily.\n\nThe occupiers left mines everywhere. In the houses they seized. Just on the streets, in the fields. They mined people's property, mined cars, doors. They consciously did everything to make the return to these areas after deoccupation as dangerous as possible. Due to the actions of the Russian army, our territory is currently one of the most contaminated by mines in the world. And I believe this should also be considered as a war crime of Russian troops. They deliberately did everything to kill or maim as many of our people as possible, even when they were forced to withdraw from our land. Without the appropriate orders, they would not have done it.\n\nThis afternoon I met on Bankova Street with an expert group working on the creation of a special mechanism for pre-trial investigation and judicial review of all war crimes committed by the occupiers. We are working on a legal way to bring the occupiers to justice, which will be as effective and as fast as possible. In order not to wait for decades until all international legal procedures are completed, but to accelerate the onset of justice. I expect that the options for creating such a special mechanism will be presented in the near future.\n\nToday, the occupiers issued a new statement, which testifies to their preparation for a new stage of terror against Ukraine and our defenders. One of the mouthpieces of the occupiers stated that they could use chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol. We take this as seriously as possible.\n\nI want to remind the world leaders that the possible use of chemical weapons by the Russian military has already been discussed. And already at that time it meant that it was necessary to react to the Russian aggression much tougher and faster.\n\nThe European Union has now begun discussing a sixth package of sanctions against Russia.\n\nIt is time to make this package such that even a word about weapons of mass destruction is no longer heard from the Russian side. An oil embargo against Russia is mandatory.\n\nAny new package of sanctions against Russia that does not affect oil will be received in Moscow with a smile.\n\nI spoke about the need to strengthen sanctions against Russia in my address to the parliament and people of the Republic of Korea.\n\nThis week I will continue this format of communication with partner countries. Tomorrow I will address the parliament and the people of the Republic of Lithuania.\n\nBy the way, Prime Minister of Lithuania Ingrida Šimonytė paid a visit to Ukraine today. I am grateful to her for the support, as well as to all the Lithuanian people.\n\nThe issue of punishing all those guilty of crimes against Ukrainians was also discussed today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. The second important topic of our conversation was the strengthening of sanctions against Russia. We will continue to coordinate our steps to force the Russian Federation to seek peace.\n\nI also discussed cooperation in the energy sphere with the Prime Minister of Norway. Expressed gratitude for the support of efforts aimed to force Russia to seek peace.\n\nI also held talks with the Chairperson of the African Union, President of Senegal. Informed him about the current situation in Ukraine, about the global threats posed by the Russian invasion.\n\nThe key task both today and every day at this time is concrete defensive measures. A concrete increase in our ability to repel any attacks by Russian troops. I am dealing with this issue almost around the clock. I'm sure people see it, too. Just as they see that the military and technical capabilities of the enemy are still very high. Yes, Ukrainians are incomparably braver. Our Armed Forces are beating the occupiers with wisdom and well-thought-out tactics inaccessible to the Russian military.\n\nBut when it comes to the necessary weapons, we still depend on the supply, on our partners.\n\nUnfortunately, we are not getting as much as we need to end this war sooner. To completely destroy the enemy on our land. And to fulfill those tasks that are obvious to each of our people. In particular, to unblock Mariupol.\n\nIf we got jets and enough heavy armored vehicles, the necessary artillery, we would be able to do it. But...\n\nWe still have to agree on this. We still have to persuade. We still have to squeeze out the necessary decisions. I am sure that we will get almost everything we need. But not only time is being lost. The lives of Ukrainians are being lost. Lives that can no longer be returned.\n\nAnd this is also the responsibility of those who still keep the weapons Ukraine needs in their armory. The responsibility that will forever remain in history.\n\nJust as our gratitude will remain in history. Gratitude to those states and politicians who really helped. Who did not waste time. Who didn’t bargain when life depended on help.\n\nI also signed several important decrees. 187 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 15 servicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine and 6 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate were awarded. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to 5 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in particular to 2 colonels of the medical service:\n\n* Ivchuk Viktor Mykhailovych** - thanks to his actions more than a hundred lives were saved in Mariupol. Both of the military and civilians.\n* **Slesarenko Oleksandr Petrovych** - thanks to his actions in the city of Chernihiv, medical care was provided to more than 450 servicemen and more than 600 civilians.\n\nI am grateful to all our heroes!\n\n**Glory to everyone who defends Ukraine!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"We still have to agree on this.

Attacked, taking advantage of its military force. This state has spent decades preparing for this war. Decades and enormous resources. Financial resources - hundreds of billions of dollars received for the export of oil and gas and used for the production and accumulation of weapons. As well as human resources.\n\nAlready about 2,000 missiles have been fired at our cities by Russia. Artillery shells are simply impossible to count.\n\nBut the worst thing is how Russia uses people to prepare and wage war. For the people of Russia such conditions are deliberately created when they are forced to live in total, utter poverty. When they can't afford even the simplest things - normal food, ordinary household appliances, normal education. When they do not have even basic human rights guarantees throughout their lives. And when service in the army for many of them becomes the only, so to speak, social mobility option. Opportunity to get at least something in life. At least somehow try to fend for oneself.\n\nWhen they got to the war and entered the territory of a neighboring state, tens of thousands of Russian servicemen were simply shocked by the normality of life. They were shocked by cities and villages where people were not in need. Shocked by home appliances in houses. Shocked that people had normal food. A significant number of occupiers simply have never seen such a thing in their lives.\n\nAlmost immediately, Russian troops started looting in the territory of Ukraine - in those areas that they managed to invade. They tried to take home to Russia everything of any value. From washing machines to computers. From auto parts to clothes. They just stuffed armored personnel carriers, trucks, stole cars and tried to take out the loot.\n\nYou know, there were cases when Russian soldiers took protective plates from their bulletproof vests to hide stolen laptops and tablets in bulletproof vests. It is impossible to believe - when a person is so poor from birth that he thinks that a laptop is more valuable than his own life in the war. But this is exactly what we saw on our land when the Russian army invaded.\n\nIt is a collision of two different worlds. The world of ordinary people who just lived a peaceful life, just wanted harmony for themselves and their children, thought about the future. And the world of people who have been specially humiliated by their state for decades, specially driven into poverty and lawlessness, so that their government can send them to any venture. To any war against neighbors.\n\nAnd this is Russia's war not just to conquer Ukraine. This is only the first step. First, Russia wants to destroy our independence, our state, to tear it apart. Wants to destroy everything that makes us Ukrainians, makes us a separate nation. And then it wants to go further to Europe. Further to Asia.\n\nIn the occupied Ukrainian territory, the Russian military purposefully searched for teachers, any people related to the army and the functioning of the state, activists, journalists. All those who educated and defended the national idea. Such people were abducted. Such people were killed. Deliberately. It was an order, it was a tactic.\n\nBut Russia has only just begun with Ukraine. The next step in their plan is to destroy other states. Attempt to conquer other neighboring nations. Russia wants to dominate. And it believes that it can do this in only one way: sending its army brought up in total lawlessness to destroy everything that allows other nations to live.\n\nWith missile and air strikes at our territory, Russia has already destroyed hundreds of infrastructure facilities that ensured normal economic and social life in Ukraine. Russian missiles and aircraft are destroying oil depots, destroying food warehouses, airports, railway stations, manufacturing plants and universities. 938 educational facilities alone have been destroyed. Almost 300 hospitals. This is a deliberate tactic of the Russian troops, not something accidental.\n\nThey are deliberately destroying residential neighborhoods and entire cities. Using artillery, mortars, tanks. Not one city, not two, not three. These are dozens of cities that the Russian military simply tried to wipe off the face of the earth. Black ruins instead of high-rises. Piles of stone and concrete debris instead of ordinary peaceful cities.\n\nWe still cannot determine the number of deceased. From the north to the south of the country - in all areas where Russian shells reached, bombs reached - the dismantling of debris is still ongoing.\n\nActive hostilities are still going on in part of our territory. Russia is preparing another offensive. Hoping to break our national resistance after all. The occupiers concentrated tens of thousands of soldiers and a huge amount of equipment to try to strike again.\n\nThe worst situation is in Mariupol, in our southern port city, which has been blocked by Russian troops since March 1. It was a city of half a million. Half a million people. The occupiers blocked it and did not even allow food and water to be brought there. They tried to capture it in the most brutal way - just to destroy everything in the city.\n\nMariupol is destroyed. There are tens of thousands of dead. But even despite this, the Russians do not stop the offensive. They want to make Mariupol a demonstratively destroyed city.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen,**\n\n**Korean people!**\n\nThis could be seen in the 20th century. And you remember that. You know what it's like to defend your land. You remember when in the 1950s you were attacked by those who wanted to destroy your freedom.\n\nThey destroyed, they killed. What would they have left from your identity if they had succeeded? This is a horrible question. But you withstood, the world helped you. Now we want the same.\n\nThere is no hope that Russia will simply stop on its own. There is no hope that reason will prevail, and the Russian leadership will simply refuse to continue this war. Russia can only be forced to do so. It can only be forced to seek peace. Forced to stop tormenting people. Forced to respect the independent life of neighboring nations. Forced to leave the territory of Ukraine.\n\nOur anti-war coalition, formed after the beginning of this brutal invasion of Russia, has already imposed unprecedented sanctions against it. But these sanctions are not enough. Russia does not yet feel that it must stop. This means that much more needs to be done. And not only at the state level.\n\nRussian banks' ties with the global financial system must be severed. It is necessary to limit Russia's exports of energy resources, especially oil. But it is also necessary that world companies stop being sponsors of this barbaric state, which believes that it has the right to destroy the lives of nations. Which believes that it has the right to sow poverty, lawlessness and death around the world.\n\nThe more companies stop trading with Russia, work in Russia, pay taxes to the Russian state, the faster reason will win. Russia will have to give up militancy and seek compromises with the world. Because it has already come to the point that Russia is openly blackmailing the world with nuclear and chemical weapons!\n\nBut working strategically, we need to protect people here and now. Protect those directly threatened by the Russian army.\n\nFor 47 days we have been defending ourselves against virtually the entire Russian army - its most capable units. Our Armed Forces of Ukraine are fighting heroically, very wisely, rationally using available resources and weapons. We receive help from around the world. And I am sincerely grateful to your state, sincerely grateful to your people for their support.\n\nBut we need much more. To survive in this war against such a prepared adversary as the Russian Federation. Against a state that does not count the dead and has countless stock of military equipment since the days of the Soviet Union…\n\nWe need air defense systems, aircraft, tanks and other armored vehicles, artillery systems and ammunition. And you have something that can be indispensable for us. You have it. Armored vehicles, anti-aircraft, anti-tank, anti-ship weapons. When it comes to survival in a war aimed at the complete conquest of the people, it is necessary to give principled answers. The usual rules for the supply of weapons must be reviewed and action must be taken quickly. It is necessary to help.\n\nProviding the necessary weapons to Ukraine means not only saving the lives of our people, not only giving us the opportunity to unblock our cities, in particular our long-suffering Mariupol, but also saving other states and other regions from further deployment of Russian aggression.\n\nEvery nation has the right to live independently. Every city has the right to complete security. Every person has the right to freedom and to seek personal happiness. People should not be instruments of some regimes, some dictators. People have the right to just live. That's what we're fighting for. That’s what we ask you to defend with us. And that is what we will rebuild - I hope together with you and the whole world - after this war.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**Korean people!**\n\nToday in this address I mentioned our Mariupol four times. Our city, which is experiencing the darkest time in its history. Our city, which Russian troops are simply destroying.\n\nI would like you to watch one video now. Footage taken by a journalist who endured weeks of Russian blockade in Mariupol. I ask you to see with your own eyes what Ukrainians have been seeing for 47 days. We ask for help to stop this. For the cities of Ukraine and other states to never see such evil again. So that Russia can never come to them again.\n\nPlease watch this video.\n    ",description:"Russia has only just begun with Ukraine. The next step in their plan is to destroy other states.

Hit back. We develop our relations with partners. We receive help. We ensure the maximum attention of the world to our needs. Influence the global debate. Propose and promote new sanctions against Russia. We are doing everything we can to bring to justice every bastard who came to our land under the Russian flag and killed our people. Who tortured our people. Destroyed our cities. Looted and tormented.\n\nAnd what is Russia doing? What are its officials, its propagandists and ordinary people doing who repeat what they have heard on television?\n\nThey are only justifying themselves and denying. They are trying to shift the responsibility. They are lying. And they have already lost connection with reality to a degree that they accuse us of committing what Russian troops have obviously done - obviously for everyone in the world.\n\nThey say about the murders in Bucha that it is not them, but allegedly us. Although it is obvious to everyone that people were killed while the Russian army controlled the city.\n\nThey say about the missile strike at Kramatorsk that it is not them, but allegedly us. Although it was their propagandists who announced this strike. Although missiles flew from the territory under their control. And about any of our destroyed cities, about any of our burned villages, they say the same thing, that it is not them either, but allegedly us.\n\nThe Russian militaries have already lied to the fact that even after more than six weeks of war, they claim that they did not hit any of the civilian objects!\n\nDo you know why this is so? Because it's cowardice. Total. Of everyone. Top to bottom.\n\nThey are afraid to admit that Russia's entire policy toward Ukraine has been erroneous for decades and has only ruined everything Russia had in its relations with Ukraine since previous times.\n\nThey are afraid to admit that for decades they have been placing erroneous bets and spending enormous resources in support of absolute nobodies who they thought would be the future heroes of Ukrainian-Russian friendship. And these nobodies were skillful at only one thing - taking money out of Russia into their own pockets.\n\nIn order not to admit mistakes, they made new mistakes. They deprived themselves of any political tools and, unwilling to give up unrealistic ambitions, started this war.\n\nAnd, as in everything else, they accused us that the war had begun.\n\nThey seized Crimea - and we are allegedly to blame.\n\nThey destroyed normal life in Donbas - and we are allegedly to blame.\n\nThey shot down a Malaysian Boeing - and we are allegedly to blame.\n\nThey have been killing people and children on our land for eight years - and we are allegedly to blame.\n\nThey destroyed the most powerful industrial region in Eastern Europe - and we are allegedly to blame.\n\nThey ruined the lives of millions of people - and we are allegedly to blame.\n\nThey started a full-scale war against us - and we are allegedly to blame.\n\nThey have already spent almost two thousand missiles, countless air bombs and artillery shells, mines on strikes at Ukraine - and we are allegedly to blame.\n\nThey tortured and killed on our land - and we are to blame.\n\nThey deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men and women, our children - and yet we are allegedly to blame.\n\nIt all came from cowardice. When cowardice grows, it turns into a catastrophe. When people lack the courage to admit their mistakes, apologize, adapt to reality, learn, they turn into monsters. And when the world ignores it, the monsters decide that it is the world that has to adapt to them. Ukraine will stop all this.\n\nNothing will help Russian cowardice. The day will come when they will have to admit everything. Admit the truth. All our strength and every minute are aimed at this. Defense, diplomacy, economics, information confrontation, legal responsibility - we have algorithms of action in all areas. Every government official knows his tasks and must fulfill them one hundred percent.\n\nNext week will be no less important than this one than the previous ones. It will be just as tense and even more responsible. Russia will be even more afraid. Afraid to lose. Afraid that the truth will have to be admitted.\n\nRussian troops will move to even larger operations in the east of our state. They can use even more missiles against us, even more air bombs. But we are preparing for their actions. We will respond. We will be even more active in providing Ukraine with weapons. We will be more active in the international arena. We will be even more active in the information field.\n\nI will continue to address the parliaments and nations of the world. We will meet our partners, leaders of other states in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. We will attract even more funds and resources to help Ukraine. Of course, we will justify stronger sanctions against the Russian Federation. So that there is responsibility, so that there is justice. No matter how afraid they are to admit their mistakes - tragic, terrible mistakes - they will have to. Because our courage and our truthfulness clearly prevail. And they will win.\n\nToday is the twelfth anniversary of the plane crash near Smolensk, which took the lives of President Lech Kaczyński and members of the Polish elite. On this day, we stand in solidarity with our Polish friends and allies who are firmly opposed to Russian aggression.\n\nI spoke today with Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz. About how to bring to justice all those guilty of war crimes. How to strengthen sanctions against Russia and how to force Russia to seek peace. I am glad to note that the German position has recently changed in favor of Ukraine. I consider it absolutely logical. Because this course is supported by the majority of the German people. And I am grateful to them. But I expect that everything we agreed on will be implemented. And this is very important.\n\nAnd a few minutes ago, in preparation for the recording of this address, I signed a decree on state awards to our heroes. 18 defenders of Ukraine. Five servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, three employees of the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine, ten police officers.\n\nI am grateful to all our male defenders! To all our female defenders!\n\nI am grateful to all those who restore life in the liberated territory of our state.\n\nAnd I am grateful to all those who ensure our victory in the information confrontation. To all journalists, to editors, to the information marathon \"United News\", to all our websites, to all media representatives that do not allow Russian propaganda to win.\n\n**The truth will win! Ukraine will win! Definitely.**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"When people lack the courage to admit their mistakes, apologize, adapt to reality, learn, they turn into monsters.

There are no obstacles to leadership. Boris was among those who did not hesitate for a moment whether to support Ukraine. The leadership of the United Kingdom in providing our country with the necessary assistance, especially in terms of defense, as well as the leadership in sanctions policy will remain forever in history. In the history of the defense of democracy, in the history of the defense of Europe. Ukraine will always be grateful to Boris and Britain for this.\n\nToday Boris arrived in Kyiv with a new package of financial and defense support for Ukraine. We also discussed new sanctions that are needed to force Russia to seek peace.\n\nThe task of our anti-war coalition is quite clear - to end this war started by Russia as soon as possible. To liberate our land from invaders. And to guarantee the security of Ukraine and, consequently, the security of democracy and freedom of the nations of Eastern Europe.\n\nThat is why it is not just the moral duty of all democracies, all the forces of Europe - to support Ukraine's desire for peace.\n\nThis is, in fact, a strategy of defense for every civilized state. To put pressure on Russia as much as possible to restore peace and security as soon as possible. To restore the power of international law as soon as possible and to prevent the catastrophe caused by the application of the law of force. The catastrophe that will inevitably hit everyone. Because Russian aggression was not intended to be limited to Ukraine alone. To the destruction of our freedom and our lives alone. The whole European project is a target for Russia.\n\nI was pleased to hear today from Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer an assurance that for the Austrian state to force Russia to seek peace is as fundamental as for other responsible states.\n\nI also heard the promise that Austria, together with its partners in the European Union, will continue its sanctions policy against Russia until the full restoration of real security in our region takes place. Until Russia withdraws all its troops from the Ukrainian sovereign territory.\n\nIn response to my question, the Austrian Chancellor also supported a clear prospect of Ukraine's accession to the European Union as soon as possible.\n\nI would also like to thank Mr. Nehammer for handing over fire engines and rescue vehicles, as well as other equipment to Ukraine, and for helping with fuel.\n\nThere is also important news today from President of the European Commission Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. As part of their global Stand Up For Ukraine campaign, they have raised more than $ 10 billion to help our people. To help Ukrainians who were forced to leave their homes because of Russia's war against Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who joined the fundraising!\n\nThat is, today was a really fruitful day for Ukraine. For our diplomacy.\n\nAnd this is the 45th day of our defense against the Russian invasion. Could Moscow think that such events would take place in Kyiv on the 45th day after their invasion? No, they couldn't even imagine it. And we made it a reality.\n\nAll of us, together - every Ukrainian who on February 24 and forever chose courage. Chose Ukraine. Chose freedom and the future.\n\nIn all international negotiations, in all contacts with world leaders during these 45 days, I always raise three topics. The first is concrete assistance for our defense. The second is concrete assistance for our people. The third is concrete guarantees of security for our state, which will definitely win in this confrontation.\n\nOf course, I do not hear specific answers to my specific questions from everyone. But there are more and more positive things for Ukraine every day.\n\nHowever, still not as much so that we can determine the exact date of the end of this war. Russia can still afford to live in illusions and bring new military forces and new equipment to our land. And it means that even more sanctions are needed. Even more weapons for our state are needed.\n\nBy the way, Boris Johnson was very specific today in answering my questions. Well, as always. We have already decided what help the United Kingdom will provide to the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. The British people are ready to take patronage over the restoration of Kyiv and the Kyiv region.\n\nThe introduction of more painful restrictions on cash flows of the Russian Federation is among the priorities for our diplomacy, for all contacts with our partners. First of all this applies to the oil business. The democratic world can definitely give up Russian oil and make it toxic to all other states. Oil is one of the two sources of Russian self-confidence, their sense of impunity.\n\nAnother source - gas - will also be shut down over time. It's just inevitable. Not only for safety, but also for environmental reasons.\n\nBut Ukraine does not have time to wait. Freedom does not have time to wait. When tyranny launches aggression against everything that keeps peace in Europe, action must be taken immediately. It is necessary to act in a principled fashion. And the oil embargo should be the first step. At the level of all democracies, the whole civilized world. Then Russia will feel it. Then it will be an argument for them - to seek peace, to stop pointless violence.\n\nAnd another piece of news for today. Long-awaited for many of our people. One of our main shrines will return to Ukraine. One of the most revered shrines of Sophia of Kyiv. The icon of St. Mykola Mokryi (Wet), the first miraculous icon of Russia.\n\nWe’ve been working for a long time to get it back. It was taken out of Ukraine during World War II. And in due time it will be at home - in St. Sophia. I am grateful to the hierarchs, clergy and faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the United States for this decision. I want the return of this shrine to be an important symbol for all of us. A fundamental symbol. A symbol that we will return all ours to Ukraine. Everything Ukrainian.\n\nWe will bring all our people back.\n\nAnd we will definitely restore justice - restore our complete control over our land.\n\n**I am grateful to all our friends!**\n\n**I am grateful to all our heroes!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"The leadership of the United Kingdom in providing our country with the necessary assistance, especially in terms of defense, as well as the leadership in sanctions policy will remain forever in history.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbpqzq5YsuM"},{id:"LBsF6_6681Q",name:"Volodymyr Zelenskyi and Boris Johnson made statements to the media",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський","Борис Джонсон"],date:"2022-04-09T20:07:03",topics:["Постачання зброї","Міжнародна підтримка"],cities:[],text:"Volodymyr Zelenskyi and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson made statements to the media following the meeting",description:"Volodymyr Zelenskyi and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson made statements to the media following the meeting",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBsF6_6681Q"},{id:"2wcrh7QWshM",name:"Iryna Vereshchuk talks about the results of the work of humanitarian corridors on April 8",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Ірина Верещук"],date:"2022-04-07T23:31:20",topics:["Гуманітарні коридори"],cities:[],text:"Iryna Vereshchuk talks about the results of the work of humanitarian corridors on April 8",description:"Iryna Vereshchuk talks about the results of the work of humanitarian corridors on April 8",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wcrh7QWshM"},{id:"EvMoHOcEL-Y",name:"The strike on Kramatorsk must be one of the charges at the tribunal regarding Russia's war crimes",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-04-08T22:44:51",topics:["Ракетний удар","Воєнний злочин","Пропаганда","Збір доказів","Постачання зброї","Міжнародна підтримка","Нафтове ембарго","Міжнародні санкції","Вступ до ЄС"],cities:["Краматорськ","Буча"],text:"\n**Ukrainians!**\n\nThe 44th day of our defense against the Russian invasion is coming to an end.

Dozens more heavily wounded remain in hospital.\n\nThis is another war crime of Russia, for which everyone involved will be held accountable.\n\nRussian state propagandists were in such a hurry to shift responsibility for the attack to Ukrainian forces that they accidentally blamed Russia.\n\nRIA Novosti reported that the strike on Kramatorsk had been inflicted when the missiles were still in the air. The day before, other Russian propagandists were spreading threats to all those who escaped from Donbas by rail.\n\nAll the world's leading powers have already condemned Russia's attack on Kramatorsk. We expect a firm, global response to this war crime.\n\nLike the massacre in Bucha, like many other Russian war crimes, the missile strike on Kramatorsk must be one of the charges at the tribunal, which is bound to happen.\n\nAll the efforts of the world will be aimed to establish every minute: who did what, who gave orders. Where did the rocket come from, who was carrying it, who gave the order and how the strike was coordinated. Responsibility is inevitable.\n\nI spoke about this today with representatives of the European Union who arrived in Kyiv. With President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and head of European diplomacy Josep Borrell.\n\nDuring the day, they visited Bucha and witnessed the consequences of the occupation. They saw how many people were killed by the Russian military. I appreciate the EU's readiness to provide the necessary financial and technical assistance to document and investigate Russian crimes. I am grateful to the President of the European Commission for her personal involvement and assistance in setting up a joint investigation team to establish the full truth about the actions of the Russian occupiers and bring all those responsible to justice.\n\nI am also grateful for the financial support - one billion euros for weapons. Plus today we agreed on another 500 million euros for defense needs.\n\nI held negotiations with the Prime Minister of Slovakia and thanked for the unprecedented defensive and other support. For the warmth of Slovak hearts towards Ukrainian men and women.\n\nWe also talked with EU officials about further steps to force Russia to seek peace. I emphasized that the existing sanctions are not enough. The pressure on Russia must be increased.\n\nIt is necessary to introduce a full energy embargo - on oil, on gas. It is energy exports that provide the lion's share of Russia's profits and allow the Russian leadership to believe in its impunity. This allows Russia to hope that the world will ignore the war crimes of its army. We will not allow this. Everyone in the world who has the courage, like Ukrainians, to resist tyranny will not allow this.\n\nRussian banks must also be completely disconnected from the global financial system. Not some of them, but all, the entire banking system of Russia. It is inadmissible that the greatest threat to global security is finding its way to global wealth.\n\nIn this context, I also evaluate the new announced package of sanctions against Russia.\n\nI believe the softness with which some in the West still treat the Russian state is wrong. We know who is constantly trying to soften sanctions proposals. And we will do our best to finally make Europe understand: in any case, you will have to impose really principled and really strong sanctions against Russia. And not some partial restriction of Russian energy exports. Not some partial restriction of Russian navigation. We know everyone who delays the decisions. But I am confident that both these politicians and these countries will change their position under the pressure of all that Russia is doing against Ukrainians and against freedom in Europe.\n\nI addressed the Parliament and the people of Finland today. I called on Finnish politicians to do everything possible to help Ukraine. I also reminded that the best way to stop tyranny and protect freedom is to provide Ukraine with the necessary weapons. The weapons we have repeatedly asked for from the West. The weapons that are available there. I will continue to fight every day, literally every hour, to get everything our state needs.\n\nRussia's war against our people may end in victory of freedom much sooner than many in the world think if Ukraine simply receives the weapons the list of which we have provided. Any delay in providing such weapons to Ukraine, any excuses can mean only one thing: the relevant politicians want to help the Russian leadership more than us Ukrainians.\n\nNo matter what, we will continue to protect our land and our people in any case.\n\nYes, not everyone in the world has found the courage we have. But we have powerful and principled partners and friends. Real friends who help Ukraine to really protect us. To really protect freedom in Europe. I am convinced that Ukraine's victory is only a matter of time. And I will do my best to reduce this time.\n\nBy the way, we also talked today about the time needed for Ukraine's full accession to the European Union.\n\nToday we received a questionnaire from the European Commission. Finally. A questionnaire the answers to which will be the basis for preparing the conclusion of the European Commission on Ukraine's readiness for EU membership negotiations.\n\nOur Government will prepare answers qualitatively and very quickly. I think in a week. Next is the conclusion of the European Commission, which will be prepared in the next few months. And then there will be the decisions of the member states and the negotiations on accession.\n\nI am convinced of our success on this path. I am convinced that we are finally close to realizing our long-standing goal. Ukraine will be one of the equals in our common European home. Ukraine will be a member of the European Union. A peaceful, sovereign, rebuilt state. We will provide it. There is no doubt.\n\nWe are also preparing for tomorrow's mass event in Warsaw, which will take place within the initiative of President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau – Stand for Ukraine.\n\nIt is about the support for Ukrainians, for our migrants. All funds will be allocated for the support of Ukrainians.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Президент України Володимир Зеленський провів зустріч з Прем'єр-міністром Словацької Республіки Едуардом Хегером, який перебуває в нашій країні з візитом.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvMoHOcEL-Y"},{id:"ZgJVk7TQZIk",name:"Volodymyr Zelenskyi Provіv zustrіch with Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic Eduard Heger",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-04-08T22:28:10",topics:["Постачання зброї","Міжнародна підтримка"],cities:[],text:"\nThe President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, was visiting the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, Eduard Heger, who is visiting our country.\n\nThe head of the state, having agreed with the Slovak people that the head of the Slovak region, is not only for supporting Ukraine in words, but for real help with the enemy, so that our country can resist the Russian invasion.\n    ",description:"The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, was visiting the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, Eduard Heger, who is visiting our country.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgJVk7TQZIk"},{id:"FKa5Yeadt-0",name:"Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Eduskunta, the Parliament of Finland",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-04-08T14:44:44",topics:["Воєнний злочин","Міжнародні санкції","Постачання зброї","Енергетика","Відбудова України"],cities:["Краматорськ","Буча","Маріуполь","Харків","Херсон"],text:"\nDear Mr. Speaker!\n\nDear Mr. President!\n\nDear Mrs. Prime Minister!\n\nMembers of the Government!\n\nDear Eduskunta deputies!\n\nDear Mr. Federal President of Germany!\n\nDear Chairman of the Swiss Federal Assembly!\n\nPeople of Finland!\n\nI'll start with what happened this morning.\n\nThe Russian military struck at the railway station in our city of Kramatorsk. At the usual train station. At the ordinary people, there were no militaries. At the people who were waiting for trains to leave to a safe area. They hit people with missiles. There are witnesses, there are videos, there are remnants of missiles, but there are no more people. At least 30 dead. About 300 wounded. This is for now.\n\nOnce again: this is an ordinary train station. An ordinary city in the east of our state. That's how Russia came to \"defend\" Donbas. That's how Russia came to \"protect\" Russian-speaking people. This is how we live for the 44th day. After 8 years of war in the east of our country.\n\nI ask you to honor the memory of all Ukrainian men and women killed by Russian soldiers, Russian missiles, Russian bombs with a moment of silence...\n\nThank you.\n\nRussia has sent all its combat capable forces from all over their territory up to the Far East to seize Ukraine. But even they were not enough. That is why Russia is gathering as many people as possible who are capable of holding weapons in order to continue the aggression against Ukraine. Looking for mercenaries around the world. Sending militants from various de facto terrorist groups and so-called \"private armies\" created by some Russian officials. We have seen so many of them among the captured Russian military.\n\nBoth very experienced killers and very young boys born in 2003-2004. But none of them could adequately explain why they need this war against Ukraine, what is the purpose of these missile strikes at civilians, what is the purpose of the cruelty that the world saw in Bucha and other cities liberated by the Ukrainian army.\n\nOf course, among the nearly two hundred thousand Russian occupiers on our land were those who did their best not to fight. Who fled to Russia, who deliberately surrendered, who inflicted severe injuries on themselves to get to the hospital and leave the war zone.\n\nBut still it was a minority. And the majority of their army continues war on our land for no apparent reason. Absolutely pointless. And as cruel as possible. Continues to fight in a way that you often think - are they people at all?\n\nYesterday, the Russian military fired from artillery at a boat with civilians on the Kakhovka reservoir. People were just trying to escape from the occupied territories. But they were hit by \"Grad\". Three children, eleven adults. On the boat. In the middle of the reservoir. Tens of meters from the shore. And they are being hit by artillery...\n\nHundreds and hundreds of cars with gunshot traces remained on all roads of our country in the areas where Russian troops entered. Ordinary cars of ordinary people who just wanted to live. The Russian military knew for sure that those were ordinary civilians. They saw that there was no threat. But they fired.\n\nThere are many examples of such cars with people who were simply crushed by armored vehicles. Literally - crushed by tanks.\n\nYou all know what the Russian military has done in our city of Bucha. But they still make such Buchas every day - from Kramatorsk to Mariupol, from Kharkiv to Kherson.\n\nAnd I'm sure you realize that if the Russian army is ordered to invade your land, they will do the same to your country. I do not wish you this. They will do what happened in Bucha to your cities. To the cities of any country that the leadership of the Russian Federation decides is allegedly part of their empire, not the land of another nation.\n\nAnd even if Russian soldiers do not understand why they need it, they will still be at war. Because it is hatred and contempt for other people that are being brought up now in Russia at the state level.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen!\n\nPeople of Finland!\n\nYou have already seen in your history the cruelty and absurdity of the invasion of Russia. Let's be honest: the threat remains. Everything must be done to prevent this from happening again.\n\nRussia's war against Ukraine is now deciding not only the fate of our state. Not only the fate of our people. But the fate of all those who have a common border with Russia.\n\nLike you 83 years ago, Ukraine has the courage to defend itself against the enemy whose forces far outnumber them. There are just a lot of them, in quantitative terms. They have a lot of equipment and a lot of missiles. A lot of people who can be thrown into the war. And a lot of dollars and euros earned from oil trade that are then spent on propaganda of aggression.\n\nBut just as your courage saved your country from Stalin's invasion, our courage resists this invasion. For 44 days already. But much remains to be done to win.\n\nOf course, unlike before World War II, the democratic world has now realized that the expansion of tyranny cannot be ignored. If the people are fighting for freedom, they must be supported. But, unfortunately, this understanding is more common among nations than among some very influential politicians. Among smaller states than among some leading states.\n\nWe still have to convince the world's powerful states on a daily basis that sanctions against Russia that it will not be able to circumvent and that will definitely stop its military machine are necessary. We still have to ask for the necessary help, for the necessary weapons. And we are still told that we still have to wait for the aircraft, anti-missile systems, tanks, anti-ship weapons.\n\nWe are told that we have to wait while we are losing hundreds of people every day from Russian strikes. When dozens of our cities are destroyed. We have to wait while more than ten million Ukrainians have become IDPs. And we have to wait. When more than three million of these ten left our country...\n\nWe must do everything together so that they can return home. We must do everything to stop Russia, to stop the war! So that peace is restored in Ukraine, and the Russian occupiers leave our sovereign territory. This cannot be delayed, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nWe are told that we have to wait... But I have a question: should both those who kill our people and those who make us wait be held jointly accountable for the deaths of Ukrainians? Those who make us wait for the most necessary. Wait for the opportunity to defend ourselves, our life, wait for the weapons.\n\nI am sincerely grateful to Finland for not delaying when this invasion by the Russian Federation began. For coming to our aid immediately. For the fact that you made a historic decision to provide Ukraine with defense support. For being principled in sanctions matters. For being one of the moral leaders of our anti-war coalition.\n\nBut I ask you to show even greater leadership, both at the level of the European Union and in bilateral relations with European countries, to support our struggle for freedom. For our common freedom.\n\nWhen this war continues, when tyranny loses the war against Ukraine, it will be one of the greatest contributions to Europe's security in decades. Consequently, one of the greatest contributions to the security of your state. That is why we need the weapons that your EU partners have. That is why we need truly effective, powerful sanctions against Russia. Permanent. Such a sanction cocktail, which will be remembered as Molotov cocktails. Insist on it!\n\nI am grateful to the Finnish companies that have already stopped working in the Russian market.\n\nBut economic ties with this country must be severed, and I urge you to put pressure on all your companies that continue to support the Russian military machine through their taxes and excise duties in Russia. All Russian banks must be immediately isolated from the global financial system.\n\nWe cannot limit ourselves to a partial response to Russia's threat to Europe and the democratic world, because freedom will not survive if the channels of nourishing tyranny are left. And we need to think together about how to protect Europe from Russia's energy weapons.\n\nEvery educated person knows that the time of fossil fuels has passed. Mankind can no longer rely on coal, on oil. We need to look for cleaner energy sources for everyone. And if Russia uses energy to finance aggression against other nations and the spread of hatred in the world, it should be an additional incentive. This should speed up the decision-making process.\n\nHow much longer will Europe ignore the need to impose an embargo on oil supplies from Russia? This is a matter of security in all senses of the word - from environmental to military.\n\nAnd I urge you to ask this question out loud to everyone in the European Union. So that the necessary decision finally appears. The world knows the formats of how to do it. And if Europe does not want to physically cut off supplies now, if it is not ready, although it is inevitable, the first step must be to apply a scheme to limit the flow of money for oil into Russia. Let this money accumulate on special accounts without Russia's access to it. Let Russia first restore peace and be held accountable for war crimes, and only then take its dollars and euros from oil trade. Let it remember the spirit of Helsinki and restore the Helsinki Accords in full, and only then will it be possible to discuss the economy, if necessary.\n\nAnd when we say that we need to stop the war, it is clear to all cultures and it is clear in all languages. When I say this in Ukrainian, it seems to me that there are no people who do not understand this. The same goes for German, Arabic, Chinese or any other language.\n\nPeace is the same value for all. War is the same evil for all.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**People of Finland!**\n\nI believe that common sense will still prevail. I am confident that together we will be able to defend freedom and defend Ukraine. That is why we need to think now about how to rebuild our state after this war.\n\nThe world knows about the leadership of your country, your people in the field of education. You have really built an educational system that allows you to protect personal freedom, make a person educated and teach respect for other people, the environment and the world. Other countries should learn this, too!\n\nDuring the month and a half of the Russian invasion, 928 educational institutions in Ukraine have already been destroyed or damaged. These are kindergartens, these are schools, these are universities. I invite your state, your companies, your specialists to join the restoration of our educational sector and the modernization of education in Ukraine. We must do everything we can to ensure that, even after this brutal war against our nation, our people continue to cultivate goodness in their hearts and stay open to the world. I believe in that.\n\nBecause hatred must lose. Freedom must win. First - in Ukraine, and then - wherever tyranny will try to raise its head.\n\n**Thank you Finland!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Hatred must lose. Freedom must win.

Russia\'s war against Ukraine. A war that has revealed the whole truth about our country, about all other countries, about Russia and about the world in general. This war shows how much everyone did not want to notice in our country. In our people. How much the world believed in foreign propaganda and Russian myths about Ukraine, not in reality.\n\nWe have always been like that... We have always been brave. The bravest in the world. I am sure of that. Because who else would do what Ukrainians do? Who else had so much courage to constantly fight against any manifestations of tyranny and defend freedom? In every election, in revolutions and in war. Who else had the courage to fight against all Russian forces on land, in the air and at sea? Who else had the courage to go unarmed against Russian armored vehicles where the Russians temporarily managed to seize something? Who else had the courage to tell the world that hypocrisy is a bad weapon? And not just to tell, but to convince and restore honesty in the world. Who else had the courage to persuade the largest global companies to forget about accounting and recall morality? And to teach all political leaders - whatever they are - to be at least a little Ukrainian... At least a little brave.\n\nIn fact, this is our brand. This is what it means to be us. To be Ukrainians. To be brave.\n\nIf everyone in the world had at least ten percent of the courage that we Ukrainians have, there would be no danger to international law at all. There would be no danger to the freedom of the nations. We will spread our courage. We will start a special global campaign. We will teach the world to be not just a little bit, but full of courage. Like us, like Ukrainians.\n\nThere are certain results already. First of all, they are manifested in the current sanctions against the Russian Federation. But that\'s the thing - the results are still "certain". Not yet the ones needed to stop Russia. To stop the war.\n\nPlease note: this is not the first day that the media has been talking not about how sanctions against Russia actually work, but about why these sanctions are important. As if they are convincing themselves that they have introduced the right things, that there are enough restrictions.\n\nBut if the sanctions really worked one hundred percent, they would not have to explain in such detail why they are important.\n\nTherefore, I emphasize once again: more sanctions are needed. Even bolder sanctions are needed.\n\nCourage must be a criterion for evaluating decisions. Courage and practicality.\n\nFirst of all, Ukraine needs weapons that will allow us to win on the battlefield. And this will be the strongest sanction against Russia of all possible ones.\n\nWe have good diplomatic news today. Russia is gradually losing even on those platforms that it considered quite comfortable for itself.\n\nIn particular, the UN General Assembly decided to suspend Russia\'s membership in the Human Rights Council. It is quite logical. Quite rightly. But also not without fighting for this decision. I am grateful to those states that have supported this decision. Russia has had nothing to do with the concept of human rights for a long time already. Maybe someday that will change. But so far, the Russian state and the Russian military are the greatest threat on the planet to freedom, to human security, to the concept of human rights as such. After Bucha, this is already obvious.\n\nAnd the work on dismantling the debris in Borodyanka began... It\'s much worse there.\n\nEven more victims of the Russian occupiers. And what will happen when the world learns the whole truth about what the Russian military did in Mariupol? There, on almost every street, is what the world saw in Bucha and other towns in the Kyiv region after the withdrawal of Russian troops. The same cruelty. The same heinous crimes.\n\nMore and more information is coming in that Russian propagandists are preparing, so to speak, a "mirror response" to the shock of all normal people from what they saw in Bucha. They are going to show the victims in Mariupol as if they were killed not by the Russian military, but by the Ukrainian defenders of the city. To do this, the occupiers collect corpses on the streets, take them out and can use them elsewhere in accordance with the elaborated propaganda scenarios.\n\nWe are dealing with invaders who have nothing human left. To justify their own killings, they take the murdered people simply as scenery, as propaganda props. And this is a separate war crime, for which each of the propagandists will be held accountable.\n\nMore and more countries around the world support the need for a full and transparent investigation of all war crimes of the Russian occupiers in Ukraine. Every murder case will be solved. Each of the torturers will be found. All those who committed rape or looting will be identified. Responsibility is inevitable.\n\nToday I continued to address the parliaments and nations of neighboring countries, our partners, our friends. Today was Greece. Today was the Republic of Cyprus.\n\nI thanked them for supporting Ukraine and joint European efforts to force Russia to seek peace. I urged to do more to stop the war. I urged Greece to use its influence as part of the European Union to save Mariupol. I urged Cyprus to take special measures against Russia. Such as the abolition of "golden passports" for Russians. As well as the blocking of yachts, the blocking of other Russian vessels in the waters of Cyprus.\n\nI am planning an address to the Parliament and the people of Finland tomorrow.\n\nI would like to note that diplomatic representatives of other states are returning to the capital together with Kyiv residents. The Turkish Embassy returned yesterday. The Ambassador of Lithuania returned today. Earlier, the Slovenian Embassy resumed its work in Kyiv.\n\nI am sincerely grateful to the friends of Ukraine who support us exactly as we need it now, also at the level of symbols, at the level of diplomatic gestures.\n\nThis is also about courage.\n\nAnd I look forward to the opportunity to have a meeting with everyone who is with us. With all who are brave. Come back. With all the diplomats who have returned to our capital and continue to work.\n\nThe presence of foreign diplomatic missions in Kyiv is a normal work of embassies, it is a clear signal to the aggressor that Kyiv is our capital. Not the provincial city of Russia, but the Ukrainian capital.\n\nThe Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to do everything to repel the offensive of Russian troops in Donbas. The occupiers’ troops in this area are becoming more active and are being reinforced from Russia. We see it all. We analyze every step of the enemy. And we will provide an answer. A tough one.\n\nAnd already a stable tradition: before delivering this address, I signed decrees to honor our bravest soldiers with state awards and the title of Hero of Ukraine.\n\n344 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded. Five more servicemen became Heroes of Ukraine today.\n\n**I am sincerely grateful for the service to each of our male defenders. I am sincerely grateful to each of our female defenders!**\n\n**I am sincerely grateful for the courage of the Ukrainian people.**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ',description:"If everyone in the world had at least ten percent of the courage that we Ukrainians have, there would be no danger to international law at all.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lIE4xvfgj8"},{id:"RiyyHsmOKYA",name:"Iryna Vereshchuk talks about the results of the work of humanitarian corridors on April 7",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Ірина Верещук"],date:"2022-04-07T21:53:45",topics:["Гуманітарні коридори"],cities:[],text:"Iryna Vereshchuk talks about the results of the work of humanitarian corridors on April 7",description:"Iryna Vereshchuk talks about the results of the work of humanitarian corridors on April 7",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiyyHsmOKYA"},{id:"rt_556gGcPQ",name:"Address by Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Денис Шмигаль"],date:"2022-04-07T20:34:48",topics:["Допомога пересленцям","Співпраця з UNICEF","Гуманітарна допомога","Відбудова України","Енергетика","Нафтове ембарго"],cities:[],text:"\n**The great people of Ukraine!**\n\nWe can say with confidence that the next stage of our liberation war ended in victory for Ukraine. The enemy's plans are ruined. Russia’s terrorist forces have been pushed out of Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions.\n\nBut the war is far from over. The enemy is constantly trying to seize our lands in the East and South. Continues to launch missile strikes across the country.\n\nTherefore, our task now is to work strenuously to continue to repel the aggressor.\n\nThose territories that have already been liberated, we will rebuild step by step. We will help everyone who was forced to move and who remained.\n\nAs of April 6, more than 500,000 new IDPs have been officially registered in Ukraine. The same number of people have already returned home from abroad.\n\nBut millions of Ukrainians still remain in other countries. The Government, together with our diplomats and the Governments of the partner countries, is working to systematize assistance to Ukrainians who have left.\n\nNow we are talking about the need to remove the roaming fee, about social benefits in Diia, the deployment of the Ukrainian educational process, the inclusion of Ukraine in the single European payment area and much more.\n\nWe welcome the decisions of the EU countries on the introduction of a temporary protection mechanism. After all, our goal is to return all Ukrainians home.\n\nA separate area of work is cooperation with international organizations in Ukraine. We have already announced a joint program with UNICEF to support large families. I want to emphasize that it will apply not only to internally displaced persons, but to all families in Ukraine. Each member of such a family will be paid UAH 2,000 per month.\n\nWhat is essential. This cooperation between the Government and UNICEF will be the basis for working with all other donor organizations that want to help Ukraine. We are working to consolidate such assistance in the Diia app.\n\nAt present, the Government's focus is also on helping our citizens in the territories that have recently been occupied.\n\nFirst, in the liberated territories, we are developing the same programs that work for IDPs.\n\nFood, medicine, and basic necessities are also sent to these areas as a matter of priority. We have purchased UAH 4.7 billion worth of food packages, and thousands of them have already been distributed free of charge to our people in frontline and liberated cities.\n\nThe second area of work here is the priority reconstruction of liberated cities. The step-by-step plan is ready. The Government authorized Ukrzaliznytsia to order all basic goods for urgent needs, including construction materials, from the state budget. The state will provide the necessary funds for the purchase of windows, doors, beams, boards and other necessary goods for emergency housing reconstruction.\n\nThis whole process will definitely take more than a week, so we are currently negotiating with American partners and Ukrainian producers to provide the vacated areas with modular buildings. Temporarily. Many people are left without a roof over their heads, so this is an extremely important task.\n\nOf course, the most important stage of our work is the restoration of critical energy infrastructure. Electricity, water, gas. Work has already begun. Where there was minor damage, light and water have already been restored. Unfortunately, there are cities and villages where this energy infrastructure is almost completely destroyed, so the work will take some time. But it will throw all the necessary forces, including from other regions.\n\nThe third point that is worth mentioning today is the Reconstruction Fund of Ukraine. A working group has been set up, which is already actively working in several areas. The first is the seizure of russia's assets in the West and the transfer of these funds to Ukraine. There is simply no single procedure in the world to do this, so we work with each country separately. But we want to receive part of these funds in the next six months to begin to quickly rebuild our country.\n\nWe are grateful to our partners who are actively continuing to freeze the accounts and assets of rkssia and oligarchic groups close to the Kremlin.\n\nThe Ukrainian people are also grateful for the new package of sanctions imposed by the United States, Great Britain, Canada and Australia. We expect that the European Union will make a statement in the coming days.\n\nThe sanctions adopted and proposed are strong but not sufficient. Ukraine hopes that the world will impose a strong oil embargo.\n\nYesterday during the meeting they discussed with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy the issue of imposing an embargo on Ukraine's trade in goods from russia. Ukraine has completely halted import and export operations with the aggressor state since the beginning of the war. In the near future, we will consolidate this with government decisions, so that everyone understands the irreversibility of severing our relations with the aggressor state.\n\n**We keep the line! We believe in the Armed Forces! We work for our victory!**\n\n**Glory to Ukrainians and glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Саме зараз вирішується, чи збережемо ми єдність нашої території та нашої держави.

Please watch a short video.\n\nGod forbid any other nation will have to go through this…\n\nExperience how Russian soldiers killed people on the roads in Bucha for fun. How in Irpin, they raped underage girls and then strangled them as experienced killers. How in Mariupol, a little girl was forced with gunshots to run down the street. Because it is permissible for them to hunt people, it is fun for them. How in Kharkiv, dozens of ordinary civilians were killed in a minute by the artillery shelling of residential high-rises.\n\nWhen you see so many deaths every day... When killed people are buried in mass graves in your cities, just in the yards, because it is impossible to take bodies to cemeteries...\n\nYou hope and seek, and believe that you will be able to save at least those whom you especially sympathize with. At least those who certainly cannot be involved in any disputes of the adult world, in any conflicts.\n\nSince March 10, Ukrainians have hoped to find a little boy alive, little Sashko. A four-year-old boy who disappeared when adults escaped from the occupiers on a boat across the Dnieper. There was no other way to escape then - the Russian military blocked all roads. They shot people on the roads. So the adults tried to escape from them by the river.\n\nBut the boat capsized. According to witnesses, after the shelling... Sashko was the only one in the life jacket, so we hoped until the end. We hoped to find him alive. Sashko’s grandma died. And later we found his body.\n\nHe became one of 167 children who died during the full-scale Russian invasion of our state. And these are only those about whom we know for sure.\n\nThere may be many more children killed in the occupied areas, in the cities around which hostilities are taking place. Children whose lives were taken by this war, Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\nWhy does Russia wage this war? What is the goal of Russian troops? The answer to these questions is quite clear. We have heard it many times from politicians in the Russian Federation and from Russian state propagandists. We also know this answer from those documents that were seized along with Russian prisoners of war and found in the destroyed headquarters of Russian troops. They wanted to destroy our statehood and tear our country apart.\n\nDivide Ukraine into parts. They wanted to take as much as they could. And all that they could not capture, they wanted to weaken as much as possible, to destroy as much as possible.\n\nRussia sought to create a new split in Europe that would meet the inadequate ambitions of the current generation of Russian leaders.\n\nThey simply do not take most countries in the world seriously. They do not respect most nations.\n\nThey consider everyone in the world either as those they want to use, or as those they want to conquer, or as those they want to intimidate.\n\nThey consider Ukraine among those in the second group. That is why Russia came to us with the war.\n\nBut all other states should think into which group they were included and what really underpins Russia's policy toward them.\n\nI am sure that no country in the world will find two things among the answers to this question - true respect and not feigned equality.\n\nThat is why the democratic world has united in its negative attitude towards Russia. Ukraine was attacked by Russia a long time ago - in 2014. When Russia tried to divide our state by force for the first time. When our Crimean peninsula was occupied. When Russia started the war in Donbas. But then the world's response was weak, very weak. Many in the world still believed that constructive relations could be at the heart of relations with Russia. That the dialogue with Russia can be sincere and based on the principle of mutual respect.\n\nYears have taught the world that this was all a mistake. And the invasion of Ukraine on February 24 this year showed that the Russian leadership perceived the good attitude of other states simply as a weakness.\n\nCan such behavior go unpunished? Is it right that the Russian state and its citizens are trying to use your island to their advantage? While trying to destroy the whole nation. While trying to destroy another state.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**Cypriot people!**\n\nI am grateful to you for the principled position with which you, together with the whole of the European Union, responded to Russia's full-scale invasion. You have adopted a powerful decision not to allow Russian warships to enter your ports. This really strengthens security throughout our region of great Europe.\n\nI am also grateful to you for your financial and humanitarian assistance. For an important resolution passed by your parliament in support of Ukraine.\n\nBut Ukrainian children are still dying from Russian weapons. All our citizens still live in hell because of what the Russian occupiers have done on Ukrainian land.\n\nRussia is still preparing plans for a new offensive against our troops, against our cities... The Russian leadership still does not want to seriously seek peace with Ukraine. In response to all our negotiating proposals, which could have been accepted long ago in the interests of peace, in the interests of all in Europe, we hear only a play on words.\n\nThis means that much more needs to be done, both at the EU and national level, to end this war. To force Russia to seek peace. Peace is an unconditional value for each of us. Therefore, I believe that together with you we will be able to provide the necessary pressure on the Russian leadership.\n\nThe Republic of Cyprus has extremely powerful tools to influence Russian society. A unique force that can be put at the service of peace. All ports in the democratic world must be completely closed to Russian ships. This must be a joint decision - at the level of the European Union.\n\nBut at the level of your state, it is also possible to at least freeze the use by Russians of all their yachts and other vessels in your waters. You can suspend the current privileges for Russian citizens. Starting from the so-called golden passports for all Russians without exception and ending with dual citizenship for them.\n\nProbably if it is verified and clearly proven that some of them condemn the war crimes of their military and do not intend to use your jurisdiction to avoid sanctions and other restrictions against Russia, only then will it be permissible to treat these people in the old way.\n\nAny efforts by Russian citizens subject to sanctions to circumvent these restrictions must be stopped.\n\nAll the proper work needs to be done to prepare the European Union for the imminent embargo on energy supplies from Russia.\n\nI do not know how many more war crimes of the Russian military must be revealed, as it was in our city of Bucha, before all EU states have enough courage for the embargo. But Russia itself has chosen this path. It destroys innocent people in Ukraine.\n\nThe democratic world must stop being a sponsor of Russia's war crimes.\n\nOf the destruction of cities, killing of children. And the democratic world must learn to guarantee real security for every state that can fall victim to aggression.\n\nWhen Ukraine says that we deserve full membership in the European Union, we mean, first of all, that we can bring to our common European home exactly the experience that can make each EU state stronger. It is an experience that can give Europe more justice.\n\nI'm sure you feel our pain. And that is why I believe that you will continue to support Ukraine, including on the road to the European Union.\n\nOn the way to our common peace.\n\n**Thank you for your support!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"It is now being decided whether we will preserve the unity of our territory and our state.

With what is happening in this Ukrainian city, which Russian troops are simply destroying. This has never happened in the history of Europe in all the years after World War II that a city is destroyed to ashes, destroyed completely. That it is under blockade and its inhabitants are killed with starvation and thirst.\n\nIt was a city of half a million people! About a hundred thousand people still remain in it. But there are virtually no undamaged buildings, the vast majority of buildings in the city are completely destroyed.\n\nThe Russian military destroyed everything. They blew up hospitals, maternity hospitals and apartment buildings. They even blew up the city theater where civilians were hiding from bombs and next to which were inscriptions that everyone saw - the inscriptions "children". The inscriptions seen by Russian pilots, which did not stop them from air strikes.\n\nMariupol is almost destroyed. I\'m sure each of you has already seen what the city looks like now. After it was approached by the Russian Federation. Just ruins. This is what Russia has done with our peaceful Mariupol. But also with your peaceful Mariupol. This city has always been home to a large Greek community. The Ukrainian Greek community is one of the largest in the world. For centuries, our people have lived side by side, raised children and built the future.\n\nThe ties between Ukraine and Greece are so old that it is now impossible to find their origin. Greek poleis on our Black Sea coast, cultural exchange and trade, community coexistence - all this is thousands of years of history. Greek Chersonesus was even depicted on our national currency - hryvnia.\n\nIt is with Greece that the development of Christianity is tied not only in our country, but also in our region in general. Ukraine is one of the largest Orthodox countries, and the light of Baptism was brought by the Greeks. If someone tried to snatch Greek roots from Ukrainian history and culture we would lose a fundamental part of ourselves.\n\nIn the same way the basic things of your history, your national self-perception are tied with the Ukrainian land. "Freedom or death!" - these words now reflect not only our struggle against Russia\'s attempt to conquer Ukraine. This is a part of your identity that comes from our Odesa. Another southern city of Ukraine that Russia may try to destroy, as well as Mariupol.\n\nWhen your foreign minister was in Odesa last week, the city was experiencing the consequences of Russian shelling, another missile attack. There are no gunshots in Odesa today. But why? Only because the Armed Forces of Ukraine are deterring Russian attacks and repelling barbaric Russian troops from their direction of attack on Odesa long-agreed by Russian leadership.\n\nRussian troops have now brought death and destruction to where Ukrainians and Greeks have enjoyed peace and prosperity for centuries. Moreover, Russia has begun a new deportation of people from the south of Ukraine. At least tens of thousands of our people have already been deported to Russia and to the territories of Ukraine temporarily occupied by Russia. These are residents of Mariupol and other cities and communities that came under attack by Russian troops.\n\nThis forced relocation of people by Russia is not the first one for both Greeks and Ukrainians. But the Russian state is carrying it out now as if deportation is not the last one. Russia is absolutely convinced of its impunity for everything it does.\n\nWe have to stop it! We must bring Russia to justice. We must save Odesa from the same destruction that Mariupol suffered. We must find everyone, all the people deported by Russia. We must save at least those in Mariupol who are still alive and who can be saved!\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**Greek people!**\n\nFiliki Eteria, founded in our Odesa, has played a role in the history of your country, which cannot be overestimated. And I urge you now, openly, to create such a new union of friends, which will be able to save the Ukrainians and Greeks of the south of our state. Which will be able to help Mariupol.\n\nThe city needs humanitarian aid! The city needs its people - survivors and wounded - to be saved. Russia has been blocking Mariupol since the beginning of March, blocking on land and at sea. It does not allow even basic humanitarian cargo into the city. I am convinced that the strength of Greece can help carry out this mission. Days are numbered.\n\nAnd now I ask you to listen not only to me. Regarding the fate of this city. Please listen to the two defenders of Mariupol who are now there, right there, and together with their colleagues are trying to stop the Russian offensive. Listen to two Ukrainians, but also two Greeks as well.\n\nOne of them is forced to wear a mask, not to show his face. Because his family, his parents are in one of the Russian-occupied towns. I hope you understand.\n\nI am grateful to Greece for the humanitarian and defense support already provided to Ukraine. I am grateful for the support of the general sanctions policy of the democratic world. But the war continues. The destruction of Mariupol continues. You have heard these heroes. The deportation of people from the territories where Russian troops came continues.\n\nI urge you to use the influence of your state and your opportunities, as a member of the European Union, to organize the rescue of Mariupol. I urge you to do more to make Russia seek peace and even give up its dreams of conquering Ukraine. Because this war that Russia has started against us is actually destroying everything that Ukrainians and Greeks have created together in a long time. What will be left after the Russian artillery and Russian bombs? I will tell you: they will destroy all our common history, our common heritage.\n\nAnd we will not be comforted saying about Mariupol in the future: "These are new Thermopylae". When the heroes died, stopping a large enemy army. Now we can save our heroes.\n\nAnd we can also drive the enemy Russian army out of Ukrainian land. We can teach Russia and any other potential aggressors once and for all that whoever chooses war always loses. He who tries to deprive of independence and destroy the territorial integrity of states always loses. Anyone who blackmails Europe with an economic or energy crisis always loses.\n\nLet\'s be honest, Russia\'s actions from the beginning were aimed not only at Ukraine, but at Europe as a whole. Russia is doing everything to keep Europeans without available energy. And to make energy poverty a new reality on the continent. Russia is doing everything to provoke an outbreak of inflation for many nations. Russia last year artificially created a deficit in the European gas market. And now it is doing everything to artificially create a deficit in the world food market.\n\nIt is a matter of honor for Europeans to respond to such a policy of the Russian Federation. As long as Russian troops block peaceful cities and deport people, no Russian bank has the right to make money from the world\'s financial system. They all must be blocked! All, not just part.\n\nAs long as this pointless and brutal war continues, no Russian vessel has the right to enter the ports of the democratic world. Why help them? For them to earn even more money for missiles and bombs to destroy not only Mariupol, but also Odesa and other Ukrainian cities?\n\nAnd first of all - no support for Russian tankers, these oil carriers, which provide Russia with a constant flow of money for the killings.\n\nUkraine needs weapons to force Russian troops to leave our country. In particular, air defense systems, artillery systems and shells, armored vehicles and other things that everyone in the West is well aware of. The sooner Ukraine receives this assistance, the more lives we will be able to save in Ukraine.\n\nAnd one more thing. Historical. Our nations have always been and will always be closely bonded. I believe that we will be able to bring peace to our Ukrainian land. We will be able to bring to justice all those responsible for these war crimes against Ukrainians, against Greeks and against all other people who fell victim to the Russian military.\n\nWe will be able to rebuild Mariupol and all other Ukrainian communities where Ukrainians and Greeks will live just as peacefully and with respect for each other as it was before.\n\nBut I also believe that Ukraine and Greece will soon live on an equal footing in our common European home, the European Union. I believe in this! I know it!\n\n**We will win everyone! But only together!**\n\n**Thank you for your support!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ',description:"I believe that Ukraine and Greece will soon live on an equal footing in our common European home, the European Union.

After what the world saw in Bucha when Russian troops retreated.\n\nNow the attitude to everyone in Russia will be simple: you support either the search for peace or unjustified massacre.\n\nKilled Ukrainian men and women in Bucha, in Irpin, in other cities that Russian troops entered is the last argument. The last argument for every citizen of Russia to decide whether you are for war or for peace. If for war, then you will forever - until the end of your life - be outcasts and in the end you will lose everything. And if for peace, if you feel even a little bit of shame for what the Russian troops are doing in Ukraine, then now is a key moment for such citizens of Russia: you have to demand - exactly demand - an end to the war. It is better now, demanding peace, to lose something, to somehow face the Russian repressive machine than to be equated with the Nazis for the rest of your life. This applies not only to any public person in the Russian Federation, not only to businessmen, but also to ordinary citizens.\n\nNazism has no future. Mass killings have no future. Everyone in Russia who will not demand an end to this shameful war and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine has no future.\n\nIt seems that the Russian leadership is really afraid that the anger of the world because of what they saw in Bucha would be repeated because of what they will see in other cities, from where we will definitely drive out the occupiers. We have information that the Russian troops have changed their tactics and are trying to remove the killed people from the streets and basements of the occupied territory. Killed Ukrainians. This is just an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more.\n\nBut they will not succeed, because they killed a lot. Responsibility cannot be avoided.\n\nWe already know about thousands of missing people. We already know about thousands of people who could be either deported to Russia or killed. There are no other options for their fate.\n\nThe situation now is that thanks to an objective investigation, thanks to witnesses, thanks to satellite surveillance of events on earth, thanks to other tools that help establish the truth we will find out all the circumstances regarding the majority of our missing citizens. Regarding most of Russia's war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nIf the world has started a debate about whether it is permissible to call what the Russian military did on the territory of Ukraine genocide, the search for truth can no longer be stopped. You can't roll it back in any way. One can only quickly abandon further aggression against Ukraine and thus try to somehow reduce the damage to Russian statehood and to those who personally adopt key decisions in Russia.\n\nIf not, if nothing changes, then it is suicide. Suicide for anyone who chooses to continue the war.\n\nToday, Western countries announced a new package of sanctions against the Russian Federation. New investments in Russia are blocked, restrictions are applied against several systemic banks in Russia, personal sanctions are added, as well as other restrictions. This package has a spectacular look. But this is not enough.\n\nStill it can hardly be called commensurate with the evil that the world saw in Bucha. With the evil that continues in Mariupol, in the shelling of Kharkiv, in Russia's attempt to launch a new global bloody offensive in Donbas...\n\nWe will continue to insist on a complete blockade of the Russian banking system from international finance. We will also continue to insist on one or another format of the democratic world's refusal to buy Russian oil. It is the export of oil that is one of the foundations of Russia's aggression. One of the foundations that allows the Russian leadership not to take seriously the negotiations on ending the war and on the liberation of Ukrainian territory.\n\nSome politicians are still unable to decide how to limit the flow of dollars and euros to Russia from the oil trade, so as not to jeopardize their own economies. But that's why people go into politics. To solve such problems, difficult tasks. To solve them quickly and in a principled fashion. If you are not capable, then you shouldn’t have started political activity.\n\nThe embargo on Russian oil supplies will be applied anyway. The format will be found. The only question is how many more Ukrainian men and women the Russian military will have time to kill, so that you, some politicians - and we know you, can borrow a little determination somewhere.\n\nIt is good that the United States Department of the Treasury has suspended Russia's ability to use US bank accounts and related assets to pay its debt. It's tangible. And I'm grateful for that. But much more needs to be done to stop the war.\n\nIf there is no really painful package of sanctions against Russia and if there is no supply of weapons we really need and have applied for many times, it will be considered by Russia as a permission. A permission to go further. A permission to attack. A permission to start a new bloody wave in Donbas.\n\nIt is still possible to prevent this. It is still possible to impose such sanctions, which Ukraine insists on, our people insist on. It is still possible to give us weapons that will really stop this aggression. The West can do it.\n\nJust as it could have applied preventive sanctions last year to prevent this invasion. If the mistake is made again, if there is no preventive action again, it will be a historic mistake for the whole Western world.\n\nI addressed the parliament and the people of Ireland today. This country was one of the first to come to our aid after February 24. And it is one of those who shows principled leadership in the European house to put effective and decisive pressure on Russia.\n\nAs a result of my address, we have good news: Ireland fully supports Ukraine's accelerated accession to the European Union. And it will do everything to increase the pressure on Russia as much as necessary to end this war.\n\nTomorrow I will address the parliaments and nations of Greece and the Republic of Cyprus.\n\nIn the afternoon I held a meeting with members of the Cabinet of Ministers in Kyiv. The key issues are the implementation of the state budget and economic activity in our country. We must do everything possible to restore the work of domestic enterprises, trade activities, and revive small and medium-sized enterprises throughout our territory where it is safe and possible to work.\n\nThe economy is also a frontline on which we fight for our freedom, for our state, for our people. Therefore, we need to constantly look for ways to adapt to the circumstances. Now we need to be as creative and bold as possible in solving economic issues. It depends not only on government officials and the central government in general. In general, it also depends on all leaders at the local level, on the political and business communities.\n\nWe must all find the necessary ideas, the necessary solutions to stabilize the country's economy together. If we need to relocate businesses from certain areas, we have to do it. If we need to update legislation and give businesses more room for development, MPs must do so quickly. If we need to create special conditions for the return of people, and the security situation in a particular area allows, every leader at any level must make every effort and do everything possible to return people to such safe areas.\n\nToday, the 42nd day of the Russian invasion has come to an end. This is not too much for military history. But for the life of a particular person - it is tangible. Right now, many of our people who left their cities, their communities after the invasion of Russia may wonder: what next? And where next? In particular, Ukrainians abroad. In particular, Kyivans and residents of other cities in the north and center of our state who moved to the western regions.\n\nAnd I call on all community leaders in areas where there is no threat of direct confrontation with the enemy on the ground to do everything possible for people to return, for people to work, for economic processes to restart. To restore normal life as much as security allows.\n\nThis applies to the entire horizontal of local government - mayors, deputies of city and regional councils. Look for solutions for every district, for every region! Together with the government, together with us, with the Office of the President, together with the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada. A working economy is just as important as our brave, strong army.\n\nThe Russian occupiers continue to accumulate fighting force to realize their ill ambitions in Donbas. They are preparing to resume an active offensive.\n\nWe are preparing for a further reduction of Russia's military potential. Manpower and equipment. We will fight and we will not retreat. We will look for all possible options to defend ourselves until Russia begins to seriously seek peace.\n\nThis is our land. This is our future. And we will not give them up.\n\nI never tire of thanking each of our defenders everyday - all our Armed Forces, intelligence, special services, the National Police, everyone who allows us to hope and believe in victory. Allows us to count on peace.\n\n**Sincere gratitude! Sincere respect!**\n\nAnd before delivering this evening's address, I traditionally signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 168 servicemen of the Armed Forces. And 3 servicemen from the Main Directorate of Intelligence.\n\n**Eternal glory to everyone who defends Ukraine!**\n\n**Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for our state!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Now the attitude to everyone in Russia will be simple: you support either the search for peace or unjustified massacre.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyXYbAd23sY"},{id:"eaETyhPrxo8",name:"Iryna Vereshchuk talks about the results of the work of humanitarian corridors on April 6",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Ірина Верещук"],date:"2022-04-06T22:04:04",topics:["Гуманітарні коридори"],cities:[],text:"Iryna Vereshchuk talks about the results of the work of humanitarian corridors on April 6",description:"Iryna Vereshchuk talks about the results of the work of humanitarian corridors on April 6",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaETyhPrxo8"},{id:"Dp_ncYg8v8M",name:"Speech by the President of Ukraine in Oireachtas, Parliament of Ireland",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-04-06T13:47:08",topics:["Ракетний удар","Блокування портів","Голод","Воєнний злочин","Міжнародні санкції"],cities:["Маріуполь","Чернігів","Суми","Охтирка","Харків","Ізюм","Волноваха","Буча","Ірпінь"],text:"\n**Dear speakers!**\n\n**The Taoiseach and members of the government!**\n\n**Dear members of the Oireachtas!**\n\n**Dear people of Ireland!**\n\nTonight Russian missiles again struck the territory of our state. Foully hitting the ordinary civilian infrastructure. In particular, the new depot with fuel. One of the dozens that Russia sees as a target. And this has already become the trademark of the occupiers – to destroy everything that helps to arrange ordinary life of ordinary people. They consistently destroy fuel storage sites, product distribution centers, destroy even conventional agricultural machinery, and mine fields. They are constantly sowing mines everywhere. In every place they are leaving.\n\nIn addition, Russia has blocked all our seaports, along with those vessels that have already been loaded with agricultural goods for export.\n\nWhy are they doing this?\n\nBecause they also consider hunger as their weapon. Weapon against us, ordinary people. As a tool to dominate.\n\nUkraine is one of the leading countries in the global food market. Without our exports, it is not simply a shortage, but a threat of famine for more than a dozen countries in Africa and Asia. Because there will be not enough volumes of commodities and prices will hike. It's a fact.\n\nIt will be harder for millions of the poor in North Africa and parts of Asia to feed their families.\n\nNow, it is the time of the planting season in Ukraine. To foil our planting season, to destroy our infrastructure is to deliberately provoke a food crisis. And what will happen due to this crisis? At least, it will be political turbulence. At most, there will be outbreaks of violence in regions where instability is becoming traditional, and a new mass influx of refugees who are simply looking for ways to survive will be seen.\n\nRussia has been using hunger against our people since the first days of the war. The worst is in Mariupol. This half-million city was completely blocked by Russian troops more than a month ago. They blocked access from both land and sea. Any access.\n\nThey are blocking humanitarian goods, do not allow to bring anything – food, water, medicine. When there was snow, people could melt at least the snow to get water, but now there is none.\n\nRound-the-clock shelling, air raids, bombing continue... There is not a single building left in Mariupol, not a single undamaged building. In the city with the population of half a million – none.\n\nThe dead and killed were buried in the yards of destroyed high-rise buildings. When they were able to do it. But in many cases it was not possible to bury. The bodies of people remained in the streets, in the ruins of houses, in collapsed basements.\n\nWe do not know how many Mariupol residents have been killed by Russia. But we know for sure that this was part of the general tactics of the occupiers. They did the same or tried to do the same with Chernihiv, Sumy, Okhtyrka, Kharkiv, Izium, Volnovakha and many other Ukrainian cities. You may not have heard all these names yet. But these are millions of people that Russia was simply trying to destroy. And continues to do so.\n\nWhen you hear this, it may seem impossible. It may seem that no one in today's world would dare to do so. But these are real facts.\n\nThe fact that the residents of Mariupol drew on the sheets of school notebooks how to find where the bodies of their loved ones are buried in the city yards. The fact that the Russian occupiers shot people on the roads as they tried to escape from the blocked cities. Hundreds of cars hit by shelling are still left on Ukrainian highways.\n\nThe fact that the Russian military did not even try to remove the bodies of killed people from the streets. While Bucha, Irpin and other our cities were under occupation, the corpses were laying just on the roads, on the roadsides, in the yards of houses – anywhere...\n\nThe fact that at least 167 children have been killed in 42 days of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. We do not yet know all the victims of Mariupol. We do not know the victims of other cities, areas where hostilities or occupation continue.\n\nThe fact that 927 educational institutions and 285 hospitals have been destroyed or damaged in the shelling by Russia. Even 73 ambulances have come under the occupiers' fire!\n\nThey bombed and shelled even churches... Even shelters, which they knew for sure that there was no one there but women and children... And that's a fact.\n\nA state that does this does not deserve to be among others in the international community.\n\nRussia does not deserve relations with it as with one of the normal states. It must be responsible for everything it has done on Ukrainian land.\n\nThe Russian military came to Ukraine as an army of colonizers. Their state propagandists, their politicians don't even hide what they want anymore.\n\nIn the 21st century, they see their state as a colonial empire that allegedly has the right to subjugate neighboring nations and destroy any basis for their independent living. Destroy even the very identity of nations. Everything that makes us Ukrainians...\n\nThe Russian military purposefully searched for and killed teachers in the occupied territories. Everyone who was associated with the army. They kidnap local government officials and kill community leaders. Along with the Russian army, units to suppress any political resistance immediately they entered our territory were created...\n\nNow, when there are discussions about sanctions against the Russian Federation, I just can't hear any doubts, I can't see any indecision...\n\nAfter everything we have experienced in Ukraine. After all that the Russian troops did. Even now, when the world already knows everything about Russia's war crimes against our people, we have to persuade even some European companies to leave the Russian market. We still have to convince Western politicians in some countries that we need to stop any connection between Russian banks and the global financial system. Unfortunately, we still have to convince Europe that it is impossible that Russian oil provides the Russian military machine with a generous flow of money.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**Irish people!**\n\nFrom the first days of the Russian invasion, you are on the side of good. On the side of freedom. On the side of Ukraine. And this is also a fact. You have no doubt whether to help us. You started doing it right away. And although you are a neutral country, you have not remained neutral to the grief and suffering that Russia has brought to Ukrainians. I am grateful to all of you for that. I am grateful to the leadership of your country, to every Irish man and woman. I am grateful for the support of sanctions against Russia. I am grateful for the humanitarian and financial support provided to us.\n\nThank you for taking special care of our people who have sought and found safety in your land. Just think about it: Russia has already left homeless 10 million Ukrainians who were forced to flee their hometowns because of this war ... It is simply impossible to accept!\n\nBut let us be aware that Russia has not yet given up on its plans. It is still continuing offensive operations in Ukraine. It is still looking for ways to conquer all our Ukrainian people.\n\nWe must do everything together so that Russia forced to seek only peace. It seek only way to leave the territory of Ukraine and give us in peace.\n\nThat is why I urge you to show even more leadership in our anti-war coalition!\n\nI urge you to persuade your EU partners to toughen sanctions against the Russian Federation. The sanctions that will really stop Russia's military machine.\n\nWe need to stop all trade with Russia. Russia's banks' ties with the world's financial system must be blocked. We need to cut off the flow of money that the Russian budget receives for oil and spends it on missiles, bombs, artillery shelling...\n\nThe world has long developed appropriate mechanisms. Everyone knows what to do.\n\nThe only obstacle is the lack of principled stance of individual leaders. Yet. Political leaders, business leaders. Those who still think that war and war crimes are not as terrible as financial losses.\n\nI'm sure your leadership can change that.\n\nI am confident that all of us in Europe together will be able to end this terrible war and restore peace and stability in Eastern Europe. It is simply impossible to procrastinate with this. The longer the Russian aggression lasts, the worse the consequences will be not only for our continent, but also for the neighboring regions of our planet.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**Irish people!**\n\nOur common principles, our common fearlessness have already started a new page in the history of relations between Ukraine and Ireland. Our mutual understanding and respect is at the level where we can say: it is only a matter of time before you and we live together in our common European home. I am grateful to you for supporting the special fast-track procedure for granting Ukraine membership in the European Union. With your leadership, it will be even faster and more profitable for both our nations.\n\nAnd now we need to think about the restoration of our country. About recovery after the war. We invite the leading countries of the planet to take part in the reconstruction of Ukraine. Of course, I invite Ireland to take part in this project. I do it with pleasure.\n\nFor example, in our Kherson region. Your ability to value life and people, your ability to live in communities, your economic potential – they are well-known. So let's join forces and show that Ukraine and Ireland together can do much more than the world's largest state planned to destroy.\n\n**Grateful to Ireland!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Сподіваюся, світ зробить висновки.

The day was very informative. I will only briefly walk through the main points of my work this Tuesday, the 41st day of the invasion of the Russian Federation.\n\nI continued my active diplomatic work. Addressed the UN Security Council, which convened for a special meeting on Russia's war crimes in Bucha and in the occupied territories of Ukraine in general. I said what should have been said in this format a long time ago.\n\nThe UN Security Council exists, and security in the world doesn’t. For anyone. This definitely means that the United Nations is currently unable to carry out the functions for which it was created. And only one state is to blame for this - Russia, which discredits the UN and all other international institutions where it still participates.\n\nWell, not exactly participates... Tries to block everything constructive and use global architecture in order to spread lies and justify the evil it does.\n\nI'm sure the world sees it. I hope the world will draw conclusions. Otherwise there will be only one institution left in the world to guarantee the security of states. Namely - weapons.\n\nI offered to the members of the UN Security Council and to all other states that respect international law specific things that could change the situation. In particular, a global conference already in peaceful Kyiv to determine how the world's architecture can be reformed given all the actions of Russia, which is still occupying the seat of a permanent member of the UN Security Council received from the Soviet Union.\n\nI also addressed the Parliament and the people of Spain. A state that supports our struggle for freedom and for the preservation of democracy in Europe.\n\nI also spoke today with President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron about the humanitarian situation in the temporarily occupied regions of Ukraine. About how we can help people in the blocked Mariupol. We also agreed that France would provide the necessary technical and expert support in the investigation of the crimes of the Russian occupiers in Bucha and other cities of our country.\n\nWe are preparing a new package of powerful sanctions against Russia for everything it has done to our people.\n\nNow is a crucial moment, especially for Western leaders. And this is no longer about how our people will evaluate the new sanctions and what I will say about them. This is about how decisions on sanctions will be assessed in Western societies themselves. After what the world saw in Bucha, sanctions against Russia must be commensurate with the gravity of the occupiers' war crimes. If after that Russian banks will still be able to function as usual... If after that the transit of goods to Russia will continue as usual... If after that the EU countries will pay for Russian energy resources as usual... Then the political fate of some leaders will develop not as usual. My advice to everyone: feel now that the moment is really crucial.\n\nWe are preparing to welcome President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and head of European diplomacy Josep Borrell in Kyiv in the near future. Working together in Kyiv is something that will be praised by many nations of the world. And not only in Europe. Because now Kyiv is the capital of global democracy, the capital of the struggle for freedom for all on the European continent.\n\nAnd I want to thank all our defenders for making this possible. For the fact that the Armed Forces of Ukraine hold most of the areas where the enemy tried to break into the country.\n\nThe most difficult situation, as in previous days, is in Donbas, in the Kharkiv direction. But we continue to do everything to ensure that our defenders have something to stop the Russian troops with.\n\nWe are aware that the occupiers outnumber us. That they have more equipment. We are aware of the attempts by Russian leaders to recruit new fools all over Russia among cadets of military schools, people with combat experience and conscripts to send them all to slaughter in another offensive.\n\nBut we have no other choice - the fate of our land and our people is being decided. We know what we are fighting for. And we do everything to win.\n\nToday in the Mariyinsky Palace I presented the Golden Star Orders to the servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine, and to the members of families of those who were posthumously awarded this title.\n\nNow it is in the Mariyinsky Palace, in the White Hall, where we always meet foreign heads of state, that such important ceremonies will take place. We will demonstrate every time that our defenders deserve respect and honor at the highest level.\n\nAnd the White Hall of the Mariyinsky Palace will henceforth be called the White Hall of the Heroes of Ukraine. I also handed over the Order of Courage to the family of the deceased documentary photographer Maks Levin who was viciously killed by the occupiers in the Kyiv region. During his life, he made a significant contribution to making us all see and know what is happening in our country.\n\nTraditionally, before delivering the evening address, I signed decrees awarding our military. 292 servicemen, 57 of them posthumously.\n\n**Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine!**\n\n**Eternal gratitude to each of our defenders!**\n\n**Everything for the victory. Everything for peace. Everything for Ukraine.**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Сподіваюся, світ зробить висновки.

Because for us in Ukraine now absolutely everything that is the basis of public life for you is under threat.\n\nWe are one of the largest countries in Europe. And one of the most variegated. But united by democracy and respect for every person, for every community.\n\nI want to give you just one example of our state, of our lives. We have the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations. Different denominations, different views on public life and relations between the state and the Church are always agreed peacefully and with respect for others in the format of this Council. This is just one example, but it shows that we, Ukrainians, are committed to peace and a conflict-free environment even in such sensitive issues that in many other societies always cause controversy and conflict.\n\nRussia came to our land with the war not yesterday and not the day before yesterday. It's been a long time. We have been protecting our country from brutal, unprovoked aggression since 2014. First - the occupation of our Crimea. Then - the war in the Ukrainian Donbas. Now - already 41 days of full-scale invasion. The worst war in Europe since World War II.\n\nBut why did Russia come to us, to our home, to Ukraine? What exactly must Russian weapons destroy?\n\nNot just our people. Not just any basis for a peaceful life. But also the opportunity to live without a dictatorship. Opportunity to live without state violence. Opportunity to be a sustainable open democracy. Opportunity of peaceful coexistence of different religions, different communities.\n\nThe format of Russian state life does not provide for everything that is absolutely familiar to us, to Ukraine. Russia wants to make sure that only one order dominates in our entire region - tyrannical. So that any diversity is destroyed. So that it is impossible to find common ground and compromises between different communities.\n\nThis is exactly what is happening in Russia now. This is exactly what it wants to establish in Ukraine. And then in the whole region of Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nAnd what will happen next?\n\nI know that for your country, for Spain, it is important for a democratic system to be protected. For peace on the European continent to be guaranteed.\n\nBut how can this be possible now? After Russia began to allocate all its state resources to the spread of war and the destruction of any basis of normal life.\n\nJust imagine this - mothers in Ukraine write on the backs of their young children the child's name, phone numbers of relatives with the usual pen... Why? Because if the occupiers kill their parents, there will be at least a small chance that someone will save these children.\n\nImagine that people now - in Europe - live for weeks in basements to save lives. From shelling, from air bombs. Daily! 2022, April - and the reality in Ukraine is as if it’s April 1937. When the whole world learned the name of one of your cities - Guernica. Imagine that in ordinary cities, conditions can be artificially created where more than a hundred thousand people live for weeks without water, without food, without medicine.\n\nRussian troops blocked our city of Mariupol more than three weeks ago. They are destroying this city completely - there is already nothing there but ruins. More than 90 percent of all buildings were destroyed! The killed people were buried in the yards near the destroyed high-rise buildings where they lived...\n\nRussian aircraft bombed even those buildings in Mariupol where they knew exactly people were hiding. Children were hiding...\n\nUkraine speaks about it every day. Every day throughout the days of this invasion. But the war continues. Russia is not serious about peace.\n\nWhat is even worse is that we still do not know how much longer the war will last until the world finally does everything necessary for peace.\n\nReally powerful sanctions are needed. The most powerful. How can we allow Russian banks to generate profits while the Russian military tortures ordinary civilians to death in Ukrainian cities? How can European companies trade in a state that is deliberately destroying our people?\n\nI know that many of your companies have already stopped financing the Russian military machine through taxes. I want to thank you, your citizens, and your government. I am grateful to these companies, to your entire state and society for the principled stance on sanctions.\n\nBut at the same time, I want to turn to some companies, such as Maxam, Porcelanosa, Sercobe and other companies - I think you know them better than I do - to stop doing business with Russia.\n\nWhat our city of Bucha, our city of Borodyanka, our other cities have experienced are war crimes. Crimes against humanity. Without statute of limitations. This is an absolutely clear basis for the Russian military and commanders to be convicted by an international court.\n\nIn these conditions, how can the countries of the world freely buy Russian oil and allow Russian ships into their ports?\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**Spanish people!**\n\nNow the fate of not only our state is being decided on the territory of Ukraine. But also the fate of the whole European project, of the values that united us all. Us with you. Of democracy that united us all. Of human rights, which have become a fundamental value for all of us.\n\nI am grateful to your country for supporting common European decisions for peace. But all of us in Europe, all of us in the world need to do even more to force Russia to seek peace. So that Russia finally starts to respect international law.\n\nWhat is needed for this?\n\nEveryone in Europe must simply stop being afraid. Stop being weak. They have to become strong. Put values and democracy above the threats that Russia spreads.\n\nI am sure fear is not about you. But I ask you to do everything so that other European countries do not have fear as well. You can help us. Help the world. Give us the weapons we need. And we appreciate that help, that weaponry - all that you have already given us. You can support further sanctions that are needed. And you can also destroy the fear of Russia wherever you can see it.\n\nBecause democracy should not fear. Freedom must be protected. Human rights must be above all calculations. The right to peace. The right to life. The right to happiness, to free development. The right to family security. The right to the future of children. The right to a decent old age of parents. The right to respect for every community. The right to be with you, Spain, together in a European family.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Бо демократія не має боятися.

And they tried to burn their bodies.\n\nI am addressing you on behalf of the people who honor the memory of the deceased everyday. Everyday, in the morning.\n\nThe memory of the killed civilians.\n\nWho were shot in the back of the head or in the eye after being tortured. Who were shot just on the streets.\n\nWho were thrown into the well, so that they die there in suffering.\n\nWho were killed in apartments, houses, blown up by grenades. Who were crushed by tanks in civilian cars in the middle of the road. For fun.\n\nWhose limbs were cut off, whose throat was cut. Who were raped and killed in front of their own children.\n\nTheir tongues were torn out only because they did not hear from them what they wanted to hear.\n\nHow is this different from what the ISIS terrorists were doing in the occupied territory?\n\nExcept that it is done by a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.\n\nIt destroys the internal unity of states.\n\nDestroys state borders.\n\nDenies the right of more than a dozen peoples on two continents to self-determination and independent state life. Pursues a consistent policy of destroying ethnic and religious diversity.\n\nInflames wars and deliberately wages them in such a way as to kill as many ordinary civilians as possible. To destroy as many ordinary peaceful cities as possible. To leave in the country where it sends its troops only ruins and mass graves. You've seen it all.\n\nPromotes hatred at the state level and seeks to export it to other countries through its system of propaganda and political corruption.\n\nProvokes a global food crisis that could lead to famine in Africa and Asia, and will certainly end in large-scale political chaos in countries where food price stability is a key factor of domestic security.\n\nSo where is the security that the Security Council must guarantee? There is no security. Although there is a Security Council, as if nothing happened.\n\nSo where is the peace that the United Nations was created to guarantee?\n\nIt is obvious that the key institution of the world, which must ensure the coercion of any aggressors to peace, simply cannot work effectively.\n\nNow the world has seen what the Russian military did in Bucha while keeping our city under occupation. But the world has yet to see what they have done in other occupied cities, in other occupied areas of our country.\n\nGeography may be different, but cruelty is the same. Crimes are the same.\n\nAnd responsibility must be inevitable.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\nI would like to remind you of the first article of the first chapter of the UN Charter. What is the purpose of our organization? To maintain peace. And to force to peace. Now the UN Charter is being violated literally from the first article. And if so, what is the point of all other articles?\n\nToday, it is as a result of Russia's actions on the territory of my state, on the territory of Ukraine, that the most heinous war crimes of all time since the end of World War II are being committed.\n\nRussian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and air strikes.\n\nThey are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation in them. They are deliberately shooting at columns of civilians on the roads who are trying to escape from the territory of hostilities.\n\nThey are even deliberately blowing up shelters where civilians are hiding from air strikes. They are deliberately creating conditions in the temporarily occupied territories so that as many civilians as possible are killed there.\n\nThe massacre in our city of Bucha is just one, unfortunately, of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for 41 days.\n\nAnd there are many other such places that the world has yet to find out the full truth of: Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Borodyanka and dozens of other Ukrainian communities, each of which is like Bucha.\n\nI know, and you know very well, what the representatives of Russia will say in response to the accusations of these crimes. They have said this many times. The most illustrative was after the downing of a Malaysian Boeing over Donbas by Russian forces with Russian weapons. Or during the war in Syria.\n\nThey will blame everyone, just to justify themselves. They will say that there are different versions, and which of them is true is allegedly impossible to establish yet. They will even say that the bodies of those killed were allegedly “planted”, and all the videos are staged.\n\nBut. Now is the year 2022. There is conclusive evidence. There are satellite images. It is possible to conduct a full, transparent investigation.\n\nThat is what we are interested in.\n\nMaximum access of journalists. Maximum cooperation with international institutions. Involvement of the International Criminal Court. Full truth, full responsibility.\n\nI am sure that every state in the UN system should be interested in this. For what? In order to punish once and for all those who consider themselves privileged, consider themselves unpunished. Hence, to show all other potential war criminals in the world that they will inevitably be punished as well. If the biggest is punished, everyone will be punished.\n\nWhy did Russia come to Ukraine, tell me?\n\nI will answer. Russia's leadership feels like colonizers - as in ancient times. They need our wealth and our people. Russia has already deported tens of thousands of our citizens to its territory. Then there will be hundreds. It abducted more than two thousand children. Simply abducted thousands of children. And continues to do so. Russia wants to turn Ukrainians into silent slaves.\n\nThe Russian militaries are openly looting the cities and villages they have captured. This is looting of the highest scale. They steal everything from food to gold earrings they just rip out with blood.\n\nWe are dealing with a state that turns the right of veto in the UN Security Council into a right of death.\n\nWhich undermines the whole architecture of global security.\n\nWhich allows evil to go unpunished and spread the world. Destroying everything that can work for peace and security.\n\nIf this continues, the finale will be that each state will rely only on the power of arms to ensure its security, not on international law, not on international institutions.\n\nThen, the UN can simply be dissolved.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\nAre you ready for the dissolving of the UN? Do you think that the time of international law has passed?\n\nIf your answer is no, you need to act now, act immediately.\n\nThe power of the UN Charter must be restored immediately.\n\nThe UN system must be reformed immediately so that the right of veto is not the right of death. So that there is a fair representation of all regions of the world in the Security Council.\n\nThe aggressor must be forced to peace immediately. Determination is needed. The chain of mass killings from Syria to Somalia, from Afghanistan to Yemen and Libya should have been stopped a long time ago to be honest.\n\nIf tyranny had ever received such a response to the war it had unleashed that it would have ceased to exist and a fair peace would have been guaranteed after it, the world would have changed for sure.\n\nAnd then, perhaps, we would not have a war, a war in my country. Against our nation, the Ukrainian nation. Against people.\n\nBut the world watched and did not want to see the occupation of Crimea, or even before - the war against Georgia, or even earlier - the alienation from Moldova of the entire Transnistrian region. It also didn’t want to see how Russia was preparing the ground for other conflicts and wars near its borders.\n\nHow to stop it?\n\nImmediately bring the Russian military and those who gave them orders to justice for war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nEveryone who gave criminal orders and fulfilled them by killing people will face a tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials.\n\nI want to remind Russian diplomats that a man like von Ribbentrop has not avoided punishment after World War II.\n\nAnd I also want to remind the architects of Russia's criminal policy that punishment has reached Adolf Eichmann as well.\n\nNone of the culprits will escape. No one.\n\nBut the main thing is that today is the time to transform the system, the core of which is the United Nations. To do this, we propose to convene a global conference. And we ask to do it already in peaceful Kyiv - in order to decide.\n\nHow we will reform the world security system.\n\nHow we will really guarantee the inviolability of universally recognized borders and the integrity of states.\n\nHow we will ensure the rule of international law.\n\nIt is now clear that the goals set in San Francisco in 1945 during the creation of a global international security organization have not been achieved. And it is impossible to achieve them without reforms.\n\nTherefore, we must do everything in our power to pass on to the next generations an effective UN with the ability to respond preventively to security challenges and thus guarantee peace.\n\nPrevent aggression and force aggressors to peace. Have the determination and ability to punish if the principles of peace are violated.\n\nThere can be no more exceptions, privileges. Everyone must be equal. All participants in international relations. Regardless of economic strength, geographical area and individual ambitions.\n\nThe power of peace must become dominant. The power of justice and the power of security. As humanity has always dreamed of.\n\nUkraine is ready to provide a platform for one of the main offices of the updated security system.\n\nJust as the Geneva office specializes in human rights, just as the Nairobi office specializes in the field of environmental protection, the Kyiv U-24 Office can specialize in preventive measures to maintain peace.\n\nI want to remind you of our peaceful mission in Afghanistan. When, at our own expense, we Ukrainians evacuated more than a thousand people from this country. And it was the hottest phase. But people needed help - and Ukraine came. Just like other states.\n\nWe evacuated people of different nationalities, different faiths. Afghans, citizens of European countries, USA, Canada. We did not distinguish who needs help, whether these are our people or not. We saved everyone.\n\nIf every time there was a need everyone in the world was confident that help would come, the world would be definitely safer.\n\nTherefore, Ukraine has the necessary moral right to propose a reform of the world security system.\n\nWe have proven that we help others not only in good times, but also in dark times.\n\nAnd now we need decisions from the Security Council. For peace in Ukraine. If you do not know how to adopt this decision, you can do two things.\n\nRemove Russia as an aggressor and a source of war from blocking decisions about its own aggression, its own war. And then do everything that can establish peace.\n\nOr show how you can reformat and really work for peace.\n\nOr if your current format is unalterable and there is simply no way out, then the only option would be to dissolve yourself altogether.\n\nI am convinced that you can do without the third option.\n\nUkraine needs peace. We need peace. Europe needs peace. The world needs peace.\n\nAnd finally, I’m asking you to watch the video. A short one.\n\nA video of what has come to replace your power because someone alone can abuse his rights.\n\nThis is what impunity leads to.\n\nIf possible - watch this video. Because there is no opportunity for everyone to come to us and see it. So watch it.\n\n**Thank you.**\n    ",description:"Where is the peace that the United Nations was created to guarantee?

Emotional.\n\nI’ve visited our cities in the Kyiv region, which we liberated from the occupiers. Stoyanka, Irpin, Bucha.\n\nOf course, now this area does not look like yesterday. The bodies of killed people, killed Ukrainians have already been taken from most streets. But in the yards, in the houses, the dead still remain.\n\nThe cities are simply ruined. Burnt military equipment on the roads, destroyed cars. It is especially hard to look at the traces of bullets on cars with the inscription \"Children\".\n\nWe have just begun an investigation into all that the occupiers have done. At present, there is information about more than three hundred people killed and tortured in Bucha alone. It is likely that the list of victims will be much larger when the whole city is checked. And this is only one city.\n\nOne of the many Ukrainian communities that the Russian military managed to seize.\n\nThere is already information that the number of victims of the occupiers may be even higher in Borodyanka and some other liberated cities. In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago. The occupiers will definitely bear responsibility for this.\n\nWe are already doing everything possible to identify all the Russian military involved in these crimes as soon as possible. Everything to punish them. This will be a joint work of our state with the European Union and international institutions, in particular with the International Criminal Court.\n\nI discussed this issue today with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. And also with Chancellor of Austria Nehammer. We agreed on his visit to Ukraine in the near future.\n\nI also discussed the investigation into the war crimes of Russian troops with Polish President Duda. We also talked about new sanctions against Russia, humanitarian and defense cooperation with Poland.\n\nAll crimes of the occupiers are documented. The necessary procedural basis is provided for bringing the guilty Russian military to justice for every crime they commit.\n\nI would like to emphasize that we are interested in the most complete, transparent investigation, the results of which will be known and explained to the entire international community. We provide maximum access for journalists to Bucha and other liberated cities of Ukraine. For hundreds of journalists from around the world. And we are interested in having thousands of journalists there. As many as possible! For the world to see what Russia has done.\n\nI'm sure you know about the new old tactics of Russian propagandists who are constantly trying to reject accusations of the Russian military.\n\nWhy the new old? Everything is simple. Because they used the same tactics when the occupiers shot down a Malaysian Boeing over Donbas. They blamed Ukraine. They even came up with various conspiracy theories. They even went so far as to claim that the corpses were \"thrown\" on board the plane before it crashed.\n\nNow they are doing the same thing. The same lies. They are trying to distort the facts. But, as then, they will not succeed. They will not be able to deceive the whole world.\n\nThe time will come when every Russian will learn the whole truth about who of their fellow citizens killed. Who gave orders. Who turned a blind eye to the murders. We will establish all this. And make it globally known.\n\nIt is now 2022. And we have much more tools than those who prosecuted the Nazis after World War II.\n\nWe must also be aware that after the revealed mass killings of civilians in the Kyiv region, the occupiers may have a different attitude to their crimes in another part of our country where they came. They are already launching a false campaign to conceal their guilt in the mass killings of civilians in Mariupol. They will do dozens of stage interviews, re-edited recordings, and will kill people specifically to make it look like they were killed by someone else.\n\nProbably, now the occupiers will try to hide the traces of their crimes. They did not do this in Bucha when they retreated. But in another area it is possible.\n\nI want to say right away: every normal person in the world understands who brought war and mass deaths to Ukrainian land. There is ample evidence that it is Russian troops who destroy peaceful cities, abduct, torture, kill civilians.\n\nTherefore, Russian propagandists and their leaders can now succeed in only one thing:\n\nmaking their work enough for the verdict of the future tribunal, which will be similar to the verdict of Julius Streicher, one of the ideologues of Nazism, editor-in-chief of the Der Stürmer weekly. He was executed for anti-Semitic propaganda and calls for genocide.\n\nNowadays people are not executed already. But all skabeevas, evening loudmouths, frontline liars and their bosses in Moscow should remember: the end of your life will be behind bars. At best.\n\nI would also like to note the reaction of the leaders of the democratic world to what they saw in Bucha. The sanctions response to Russia’s massacre of civilians must finally be powerful. But was it really necessary to wait for this to reject doubts and indecision? Did hundreds of our people really have to die in agony for some European leaders to finally understand that the Russian state deserves the most severe pressure?\n\nThis breaks the heart of every Ukrainian. It breaks my heart. Because only now do we hear from all world leaders statements that should have been made long ago, when everything was already completely clear.\n\nI emphasize once again: Ukraine must get all the necessary weapons to drive the occupiers out of our land as soon as possible, to liberate our cities. And if we had already got what we needed - all these planes, tanks, artillery, anti-missile and anti-ship weapons, we could have saved thousands of people. I do not blame you - I blame only the Russian military. But you could have helped.\n\nI will continue to say this to the face of all those on whom the decision on weapons for Ukraine depends.\n\nWe have already started preparing all the necessary work to restore normal life in the liberated areas. Mine clearance of the territory is carried out. Our sappers neutralize thousands of explosive devices every day! In the near future we will restore electricity supply, restore water supply to this whole territory of our state. We will provide medical care, normal access to goods - as much as possible in the current conditions.\n\nOf course, we will rebuild the destroyed and damaged housing. We will rebuild roads, bridges, infrastructure. Life will come again to every city, to every community that the occupiers tried to destroy.\n\nThis week I continue to address the parliaments of the nations of the world. Today was Romania. I thanked the Romanian people for their warm attitude towards our migrants. It's true. I called for greater sanctions against Russia. I also said that Romania's leadership was indispensable for ensuring security in the Black Sea region and for restoring justice in Europe as a whole.\n\nTomorrow I will address the Spanish Parliament. And also the UN Security Council.\n\nToday I expressed condolences to the President of the Republic of Lithuania and to the entire Lithuanian people over the brutal murder of the world-famous documentary filmmaker Mantas Kvedaravičius by the Russian occupiers in Mariupol. In 2016, he made a film about our peaceful Mariupol, which shortly before found itself on the frontline of the war in Donbas. And now it was there that his life was taken. May the memory of him live forever!\n\nWe continue to prepare for even more brutal activity of the occupiers in the eastern and southern directions. We know what they are going to do in Donbas. We know what they are going to do near Kharkiv, in some other parts of the country. Russia concentrates a significant amount of military and equipment there. And this activity proves that sanctions imposed against Russia are not enough. There will be more.\n\nIf the Russian leadership does not begin to really seek peace, really negotiate peace, they will put their country in the worst condition in 50 years. The so-called wicked 90's will seem prosperous and calm.\n\nAnd traditionally, before delivering this address, I signed a decree awarding our Ukrainian heroes. 152 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine received state awards, three of them posthumously.\n\n**Eternal glory to all our heroes!**\n\n**Eternal memory to everyone who perished for our country!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"We are already doing everything possible to identify all the Russian military involved in these crimes as soon as possible.

It is these territories from which we expelled the Russian occupiers and saw what they had been doing to the Ukrainian people on our land. And I want you to see it now. What the occupiers left behind. I apologize - the video is brutal, but it\'s a reality...\n\nThe name of our city of Bucha is now forever in world history. In the history of war crimes. In the history of the extermination of people.\n\nAs of now, we know about more than 300 civilians tortured, executed or otherwise killed in Bucha. Ordinary residents of an ordinary city near Kyiv. Their hands were tied behind their backs, they were shot in the back of the head or in the eye, killed just in the streets. Civilian vehicles were crushed by military equipment. Vehicles with people! They raped women and girls...\n\nAnd this is just the beginning of the investigation. Not all evidence has been collected yet. Not all burials have been discovered yet. Not all basements where the Russian military tortured people have been inspected yet. There is every reason to believe that the number of killed residents of Bucha and other Ukrainian cities nearby will be much higher than what we know today.\n\nWhy did the Russian military do that?\n\nOn the same day, April 3, when the world was horrified to see the bodies of those killed in Bucha, an article justifying the genocide of Ukrainians was published on the website of the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Its name is quite eloquent, I quote: "What should Russia do with Ukraine". And it\'s not just text. This is one of the proofs for the future tribunal against Russian war criminals.\n\nThe article describes a clear and calculated procedure for the destruction of everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainians and our people themselves. Those whom they will not be able to break and conquer. It is said that "de-Ukrainization" and "de-Europeanization" of Ukraine should be carried out. It is said that even the name of our state should be erased. Virtually, it is said that the deaths of as many of our people in the war are only welcomed.\n\nI want to emphasize once again: this is the website of the state news agency of Russia, where, under conditions of explicit state censorship, only materials that correspond to the official ideological position on the war against Ukraine can be published. What does not correspond to such a position would simply not pass censorship.\n\nI want you to understand me: they are not even hiding. They openly speak about the purpose of the invasion of Ukraine. If our army had not withstood, if our people had not risen to the defense of the state, they would have done what they did in Bucha - but throughout Ukraine.\n\nWe know about the deliberate killings of teachers and educators in the temporarily occupied territories. We know about deliberate terror against all those whom the occupiers considered as activists, as people related to the army.\n\nEven the mere presence of the national symbols of Ukraine, the state flag or coat of arms, in a person\'s apartment was already a reason for the occupiers to kill this person or at least threaten to kill him or her.\n\nBut why aren\'t they hiding?\n\nWhy do they even now, when everything is clear to the world, openly say how they want to destroy the whole nation?\n\nThere are two answers to this question.\n\nYou will understand the first answer very well.\n\nIn 1989, Nicolae Ceaușescu finally ended his life. For many years it has been clear that this man had lost his adequacy. It has been clear that he, his wife, his entourage, his "Securitate" have been dragging your country and people down - to suffering, to poverty, to isolation not just from the world, but from everything advanced in the world.\n\nThat regime relied only on intimidation, repression, brutality and deception. There was nothing bright in it. The Romanian people revolted and defended themselves, saved themselves. Having overthrown inadequate power. Because that was the only way. Ceaușescu, his wife, his entourage, his "Securitate" could not be convinced of anything.\n\nIt is also impossible to convince those who promote war in Russia now. Who give criminal orders. Who develop plans for the genocide of the Ukrainian people and the destruction of the Ukrainian state. These people are inadequate. They have lost all connection with reality and are willing to sacrifice millions of lives to realize their crazy ideas.\n\nAnd the second reason why Russia is openly calling for genocide and why the crimes of the occupiers that everyone in the world saw in Bucha are possible is the belief of Russia\'s top officials that European leaders will fail, will be weak. That Europe will lack leadership. And that the nations of Europe are incapable of defending the values that have united the continent.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**Great Romanian people!**\n\nTogether we must stop these inadequate people who are accustomed to impunity and therefore decided that they are allowed absolutely everything. Together we must stop those who want genocide in Europe.\n\nWhy must we do this together?\n\nEach of you understands that Ukraine is not the last target of Russian aggression. Troops of occupiers are stubbornly trying to bypass our city of Mykolaiv to try to seize Odesa. And from Odesa there is one step to Moldova.\n\nRussian state propagandists have long said that Moldova is also a target for Russian expansion. Therefore, the defense of Ukrainians of their own state is a fundamental prerequisite for security and independence of Moldova. And therefore a prerequisite for peace in the whole large region of the Danube.\n\nNow the fate of the whole of Eastern and Central Europe and the Black Sea region is being decided on the territory of Ukraine. Therefore, to protect the freedom of Ukraine, to protect the freedom of Ukrainians is to guarantee the security of Europe.\n\nWhat must be done?\n\nYes, it is true, sanctions were imposed on Russia for this war. But the war for our freedom has been going on for 40 days already. After 8 years of war in Donbas. Therefore, sanctions are not enough.\n\nRussia must seek peace with Ukraine and with the whole of Europe. To this end, Russia must be deprived of all resources. First of all, financial and economic ones.\n\nThe European Union must finally adopt a principled decision and close ports to Russian ships.\n\nStop the transit of goods and any economic activity with Russia. Restricting the flow of money for Russian energy has no alternative.\n\nOne can argue about what the format should be: a full embargo on supplies or a program like "Oil-for-Food" - but it is necessary.\n\nAnd not only that.\n\nEvery politician in a democratic world must defend the need to provide Ukraine with all the necessary weapons. Because it is on the battlefield that it is decided who will be the winner in this war - freedom or tyranny.\n\nEveryone on whom it depends must do everything possible to quickly and inevitably bring to justice all Russian servicemen and their commanders guilty of committing crimes against civilians in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine.\n\nToday, I reached an agreement with the European Union on the provision of financial and technical support to the Eurojust Joint Investigation Team, EU member states and the International Criminal Court.\n\nI believe that Romania\'s leadership will be one of the decisive factors in restoring justice and protecting normal life both in our region and in Europe as a whole.\n\nI am confident that Romania and Romanian companies will also take part in Ukraine\'s post-war reconstruction program. We invite our partners in Europe to take patronage over a city, region or industry that has suffered from Russia\'s aggression. Your potential, your inner strength can create a new example of leadership in building a civilized and peaceful life.\n\nI am sincerely grateful to all the Romanian people for their kind treatment of Ukrainian immigrants who have found safety on your land. I hope that together we will be able to create such conditions as soon as possible, when Russia will give up the war, and so our people will be able to return home to Ukraine. And this experience of assistance in emergency situations, mutual respect, kindness between our people has already become the basis for even greater rapprochement of our states, our nations.\n\nAs soon as the situation allows, I want to start a dialogue with you on a new comprehensive agreement that guarantees the absolute protection and development of our national minorities - the Ukrainian community in Romania and the Romanian community in Ukraine.\n\nBecause our destiny is to be as close as we can. Our destiny is to be defenders of freedom in our region. Our destiny is to be together in the European family.\n\nAnd I believe that very soon I will be able to address you with words of gratitude for Romania\'s support for Ukraine\'s accession to the European Union.\n\n**Thank you very much!**\n\n**Glory to Romania!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ',description:"The name of our city of Bucha is now forever in world history.

They came to destroy our freedom. They came to destroy our state. They came to destroy the Ukrainian people.\n\nWhat happened in Bucha, Hostomel, Irpin, Motyzhyn and other towns and villages around Kyiv is an illustration of this evil. This is one of the episodes of their appalling crimes, which are currently happening in Mariupol, Izyum, Kharkiv, Kherson, Donetsk, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhia regions.\n\nJust as the Nazis 80 years ago wanted to finally resolve the "Jewish question", so russia now wants to finally solve the "Ukrainian question". But this will not happen. Whoever will come to us with a sword, from a sword will perish.\n\nrussian soldiers and their commanders who do not die now will inevitably be held accountable in the future. We will do everything for that.\n\nWe must work tirelessly. Everyone does his or her job. We must secure a reliable home front for our army.\n\nTo remain free on our land.\n\nThe Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine continues its work. We restarted the economy and put it on the military rails. What are the main innovations and results of the last week?\n\n* UAH 73 billion was allocated to the reserve fund to promptly provide the army with everything it needs. Expenditures on the Verkhovna Rada, the Cabinet of Ministers, judges, and prosecutors were reduced.\n* Pensions were fully paid in March for all retirees. Payments for frontline regions were made in advance in April.\n* A program of payments of UAH 6,500 to all those who lost their jobs is being successfully implemented. Applications were received from 5 million people. Most people have already received funds, other payments will be shortly allocated.\n* A program to support IDPs was launched. We find housing for people. We provide funds for the business to hire IDPs.\n* We have launched in Diia app the function which allows to provide information about destroyed housing. In addition, we approved the procedure for calculating all losses, which consists of 15 areas: from property and infrastructure losses to losses of enterprises and the economy as a whole.\n* We started a sowing campaign. Now sowing is taking place in almost all regions of the country. Seeds, fertilizers, fuel - all these are in place. The state has provided farmers with funding of over UAH 20 billion. Loans to all at 0%.\n* We launched a program to purchase food packages for further free distribution to people in frontline cities. 10 million packages. We buy almost everything from a Ukrainian manufacturer. We load our food industry with orders.\n* We continued to help relocate Ukrainian manufacturing companies. Almost 1,500 applications were received. More than 100 companies have already relocated and are operating.\n* New logistics routes have been formed for the maximum possible recovery of Ukrainian exports. We are looking for new opportunities and creating new infrastructure at the borders.\n* More than 150,000 businesses are already switching to a new tax system - 2% of turnover.\n* Over the past week, we have new arrangements for support from foreign partners worth another USD 1 billion.\n* There are no more queues at customs to import goods. All humanitarian aid is issued in 10 minutes.\n\nThere is a lot of work ahead. There are many severities and challenges ahead.\n\nBut we see who our enemy is. We understand what we are fighting for. For the life of our people. For the existence of the Ukrainian state.\n\nWe will definitely win this war, but the war will end for us when all those who gave and carried out criminal orders will be held accountable.\n\n**I express gratitude to our defenders, our glorious army.**\n\n**I express gratitude to everyone who is working and paying every effort to approach this victory closer!**\n\n**Glory to Ukrainians! Glory to Ukraine!**\n\n    ',description:"In these 40 days, each of us has understood why russian terrorists came to our land. They came to destroy our freedom. They came to destroy our state.

And who deserve only death after what they did.\n\nI want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed? What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians in an ordinary peaceful city tortured to death? Why were women strangled after their earrings were ripped out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? How could their corpses be desecrated even after death? Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible?\n\nRussian mothers! Even if you raised looters, how did they also become butchers? You couldn't be unaware of what's inside your children. You couldn't overlook that they are deprived of everything human. No soul. No heart. They killed deliberately and with pleasure.\n\nI want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being fulfilled. Such orders. Such a fulfillment. And joint responsibility. For these murders, for these tortures, for these arms torn off by explosions that lie on the streets. For shots in the back of the head of tied people.\n\nThis is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image.\n\nYour culture and human appearance perished together with the Ukrainian men and women to whom you came.\n\nI approved a decision to create a special mechanism of justice in Ukraine for the investigation and judicial examination of every crime of the occupiers on the territory of our state. The essence of this mechanism is the joint work of national and international experts: investigators, prosecutors and judges. This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Office of the Prosecutor General, the National Police, the Security Service, the Intelligence Service and other structures within their competence must make every effort to ensure that the mechanism is operational immediately.\n\nI call on all our citizens and friends of Ukraine in the world who can join this work and help establish justice to do so.\n\nThe world has already seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it is time to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth.\n\nEveryone guilty of such crimes will be included in a special Book of Torturers, will be found and punished.\n\nUkrainians!\n\nI want you to realize that. We drove the enemy out of several regions. But Russian troops still control the occupied areas of other regions. And after the expulsion of the occupiers, even worse things can be found there. Even more deaths and tortures. Because this is the nature of the Russian military who came to our land. These are bastards who can't do otherwise. And they had such orders.\n\nAll partners of Ukraine will be informed in detail about what happened in the temporarily occupied territory of our state. War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the UN Security Council on Tuesday.\n\nThere will definitely be a new package of sanctions against Russia. But I'm sure that's not enough. More conclusions are needed. Not only about Russia, but also about the political behavior that actually allowed this evil to come to our land.\n\nToday is the fourteenth anniversary of the NATO summit in Bucharest. Then there was a chance to take Ukraine out of the \"gray zone\" in Eastern Europe. Out of the \"gray zone\" between NATO and Russia.\n\nOut of the gray zone, in which Moscow thinks they are allowed everything. Even the most dreadful war crimes.\n\nUnder optimistic diplomatic statements that Ukraine could become a member of NATO, then, in 2008, refusal to accept Ukraine into the Alliance was hidden. The absurd fear of some politicians towards Russia was hidden. They thought that by refusing Ukraine, they would be able to appease Russia, to convince it to respect Ukraine and live normally next to us.\n\nDuring the 14 years since that miscalculation, Ukraine has experienced a revolution and eight years of war in Donbas. And now we are fighting for life in the most horrific war in Europe since World War II.\n\nI invite Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy to visit Bucha and see what the policy of concessions to Russia has led to in 14 years. To see with their own eyes the tortured Ukrainian men and women.\n\nI want to be understood correctly. We do not blame the West. We do not blame anyone but the specific Russian military who did this against our people. And those who gave them orders. But we have the right to talk about indecision. About the path to such Bucha, to such Hostomel, to such Kharkiv, to such Mariupol. We have no indecision. No matter whether we are in a certain bloc or non-aligned, we understand one thing: we must be strong.\n\nFourteen years ago, Russia's leader in Bucharest told Western leaders that there was no country like Ukraine. And we prove that there is such a country. It was and it will be.\n\nWe will not hide behind the strong of this world. We will not beg anyone.\n\nHonestly, we shouldn’t have asked for help with weapons to protect ourselves from this evil that came to our land. All the necessary weapons should have been given to us anyway - without requests. Because they themselves realized what evil had come and what it had brought with it.\n\nWe see what’s at stake in this war. We see what we are defending.\n\nThere are standards of the Ukrainian army - moral and professional. And it is not our army that has to adjust now. These are many other armies that should learn from our military.\n\nAnd there are standards of the Ukrainian people. And there are standards of the Russian occupiers. This is good and evil. This is Europe and a black hole that wants to tear it all apart and absorb.\n\nWe will win this war. Even if individual politicians are still unable to overcome the indecision they will pass on to their successors together with their offices.\n\nAnd all the necessary services are already working in Bucha to bring the city back to life. Restore electricity supply, water supply. Restore the work of medical institutions. Rebuild the infrastructure. Give security to people. Because Russia was expelled. And Ukraine is returning. And brings life back.\n\nToday I visited our border guards, our heroes in the hospital of the Border Guard Service of Ukraine. Wounded warriors.\n\nI presented state awards to the eight of them. I also awarded the orthopedist-traumatologist - medical service officer who is a leading military traumatologist in Ukraine and has already saved many Ukrainian defenders.\n\nIn total, 41 border guards received state awards under this decree.\n\nIt was the servicemen of the State Border Guard Service who first met the occupiers with fire when they went on the offensive on February 24. Now our boys and girls are returning to the state border as we expel the occupiers.\n\nI am sure the time will come and the whole line of the state border of Ukraine will be restored.\n\nAnd for this to happen sooner, we must all be focused, ready to boldly face evil and respond to every criminal act against Ukraine, against our people, against our freedom.\n\n**Evil will be punished.**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"The world has already seen many war crimes.

Another day of many that are gradually, with difficulties, but steadily bringing us closer to peace. To peace that no one will give us a gift. We need to understand it clearly. Because there are no subjects in the world that can stop wars and give peace.\n\nThe global security architecture has failed. Peace for us will not be the result of any decisions of the enemy somewhere in Moscow as well. We should not cherish empty hopes that they will simply leave our land. We can only gain peace. We can gain it in hard battles and in parallel - in negotiations, and in parallel - in daily vigorous work.\n\nTherefore, each of us must continue to do everything we can. In all directions. To support our Armed Forces. To preserve and develop economic activity in Ukraine - as much as possible now.\n\nTo support all our citizens... Wherever they are, whoever they are.\n\nIn peacetime warm words sustained the vital forces. And in wartime it is even more important. When we may not even know what a person is going through. What a loss. What help a person needs. But we can see that a person needs help. We need to support this person. We should at least hear this person. Say a few kind words. Something needs to be done to support the life of this person. This must be done. You should be attentive to everyone around you!\n\nWhen people defend themselves in a war of annihilation, when there is a question of the lives or deaths of millions, there are no unimportant things. There are no unimportant moments. Everything matters. And everyone can contribute to the victory of all. Someone with a weapon in their hands. Someone - at work. And someone - with a warm word and help at the right time.\n\nSo do everything you can for us to withstand together in this war for our freedom, for our independence. For Ukraine to live.\n\nDue to such sincere and constant support of each other, due to unity and attention to the neighbor, the people can overcome the most difficult challenges. And drive out the enemy, which is many times bigger in numbers.\n\nOur defenders continue to regain control over communities in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions. There are more and more Ukrainian national flags in the areas that have been temporarily occupied.\n\nThe Armed Forces of Ukraine do not release the invaders without a fight. Inflict fire damage. They are destroying everyone we can reach.\n\nWe are strengthening our defenses in the eastern direction and in Donbas. We are aware that the enemy has reserves to increase pressure in the east.\n\nWhat is the goal of Russian troops? They want to capture both Donbas and the south of Ukraine. What is our goal? Protect us, our freedom, our land and our people.\n\nDo everything for protection.\n\nOur heroic Mariupol continues to hold back a significant part of the enemy forces. Thanks to this resistance, thanks to the courage and resilience of our other cities, Ukraine has gained invaluable time. The time that allows us to undermine the enemy's tactics and weaken their capabilities.\n\nUnfortunately, Ukraine has not yet received enough modern Western anti-missile systems. Has not received aircraft. Hasn’t received what the partners could provide. Could - and still can!\n\nEvery Russian missile that hit our cities and every bomb dropped on our people, on our children only adds black paint to the history that will describe everyone on whom the decision depended. Decision whether to help Ukraine with modern weapons.\n\nI would like to thank the residents of our Enerhodar separately. Those brave Ukrainians who went to a rally today to defend their city. To protect our state.\n\nIn response, the occupiers opened fire and used grenades against completely peaceful people, which are on their land, within their law. There will be an answer for each wounded person. And the Ukrainian character cannot be conquered by any pressure or violence.\n\nI am grateful to everyone who takes to the streets in the temporarily occupied cities. To all who are not afraid and go out. I am grateful to all who are afraid and come out. To all those who feel that without this decision to defend Ukraine and their freedom, the occupiers can gain a foothold.\n\nAnd when people protest - and the more people protest - the harder it is for the occupiers to destroy us, to destroy our freedom. This is our common struggle! And it will be our common victory.\n\nI would also like to say a few words to those politicians, some deputies of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine who absolutely do not understand what is happening in the hearts of our people. They don't understand it so much that they even decided to change the national anthem. I have a question for these people: what have you done in your life to give you the moral right to change the words of the anthem? Are you outstanding poets? Maybe you excelled in the battles for Ukraine? Or now is such a time that you can change the anthem whenever you want?\n\nCool down emotions. Stop pretending to be fools. I believe that the authors of these and other similar bills, proposals, should take up arms and go to the battlefield, if you have these opportunities. Only there will you understand something.\n\nAnd even if they accidentally vote for something like this, I still will not sign such bills. Don't waste time.\n\nI want to turn to another person who does not seem to fully understand what is happening. Not only in Ukraine, but throughout Europe. To the Prime Minister of Hungary. He is virtually the only one in Europe to openly support Mr. Putin.\n\nWe did not ask for anything special from official Budapest. We didn't even get what everyone else is doing! Doing for the sake of peace. We did not receive the vital transit of defense aid, we did not see moral leadership.\n\nWe saw no effort to stop the war! Why so?\n\nThe whole of Europe wants peace. The whole of Europe does not want the battlefield to be moved from Mariupol to Budapest or from Kharkiv to Krakow or from Chernihiv to Vilnius.\n\nThe whole of Europe is trying to stop the war, to restore peace. Then why is official Budapest opposed to the whole of Europe, to all civilized countries? For what?\n\nThe main thing for us is the opinion of the people. The Ukrainian people support the Hungarian people. The Hungarian people support the Ukrainian people. We value peace equally, we value freedom equally. It will always be so. We will always live in good neighborliness. And I am convinced that our minorities should be the bridges that unite us even more.\n\nPoliticians come and go. And the truth remains. That's what I'm talking about - the truth. And I always say what I think. When I am speaking of Hungary, I mean Hungary. And I don't need to mask my thoughts. If we need to speak of Germany, we are speaking of Germany. If I need to speak of another country, I'm speaking of another country.\n\nIf it's a war, then I call it a war, not a \"special operation.\" If this is a threat to the whole of Europe, then I call it a threat to the whole of Europe.\n\nThis is called the honesty that Mr. Orban lacks. He may have lost it somewhere in his contacts with Moscow.\n\nI spoke today with the President of Colombia. I am very grateful to him for his support and solidarity with Ukraine. The list of countries that honestly say that freedom matters and the war must stop is expanding.\n\nI also spoke with British Prime Minister Johnson. A meaningful, pleasant conversation. We agreed on new defensive support for Ukraine. New package. Very, very tangible support. We also agree on the strengthening of sanctions against Russia. Extremely tangible. Agreed on joint steps to achieve peace. Thank you Boris for the leadership! Historical leadership. I'm sure of it.\n\nIn the afternoon I held a large meeting with the economic bloc of the Cabinet of Ministers and the Office of the President. The economic frontline is another direction of our struggle for our state, for our people.\n\nWe discussed in great detail the situation with sowing, with the supply of food to Ukrainians, with the supply of fuel, the situation in the energy sector, the situation with the main sectors of the state.\n\nThe Minister of Finance reported on the state of implementation of the state budget, details of negotiations with partners on financial support for Ukraine.\n\nIn wartime, economic relations must remain one hundred percent managed, no matter how difficult it may be for all of us. Because it's about perspective. About the perspective of life for more than 40 million Ukrainians, about what our tomorrow will be like. The participants of the meeting received clear tasks.\n\nAnd finally. Already traditional.\n\nI signed a decree on state awards to our heroes - the heroes of our state. 131 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, nine of them - posthumously.\n\n**Eternal glory to them all!**\n\n**Eternal glory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine!**\n\n**Eternal glory to all our defenders!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Глобальна архітектура безпеки виявилась неспроможною.

One such joke is about people in Russia. They started the spring conscription, which looks traditional, but is still different from the usual. Because this year's conscripts can be sent to war against our state, against our people. So, this is a guaranteed death for many very young guys.\n\nAnd although they are not our citizens, although they are citizens of the state that is at war with us on our land, it is still our duty as people to warn.\n\nWarn each such conscript, their parents. We don't need more dead people here. Save your children so that they do not become villains. Don't send them to the army. Do whatever you can to keep them alive. At home. At their home.\n\nThe Russians won’t be told the whole truth about this conscription and about the fate of the conscripts. But still, if you can convey the truth to them - do it.\n\nI want to dwell on the fact that the Russian Federation is trying to take people into the army in Crimea. This is a violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime for which there will be responsibility. And which is also an argument for increasing sanctions against Russia.\n\nThat's why I want to tell the people of Crimea: sabotage this story. At any stage. And if it doesn't work out, don't fulfill criminal orders and surrender to the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the first opportunity. We will understand everything. You will live.\n\nThe occupiers played a second very silly April Fool's joke with some residents of the southern regions of Ukraine, where Russian troops had temporarily entered.\n\nThey appoint some \"Gauleiters\", some temporary leaders. And they are threatening employees of enterprises and authorities to cooperate with these deceived appointees.\n\nMy message to them is simple: the responsibility for collaboration is inevitable. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is a secondary issue. The main thing is the inevitability that justice will be restored. Therefore, everyone who became a Gauleiter can already register somewhere in Rostov. And there will be problems for cooperation with them or with the occupiers directly. This is the last warning.\n\nThe occupiers are withdrawing forces in the north of our country. The withdrawal is slow but noticeable. Somewhere they are expelled with battles. Somewhere they leave positions on their own. After them a complete disaster and many dangers are left. It's true.\n\nFirstly, the bombing may continue. Secondly, they are mining all this territory. Mining houses, equipment, even the bodies of killed people. Too many tripwire mines, too many other dangers...\n\nWe are moving forward. Moving carefully. And everyone who returns to this area must also be very careful! It is still impossible to return to normal life as it was. Even in the areas we return after the fighting. You will have to wait. Wait for our land to be cleared. Wait until you can be assured that new shelling is impossible.\n\nIn the east of our country, the situation remains extremely difficult. The Russian militaries are being accumulated in Donbas, in the Kharkiv direction. They are preparing for new powerful blows. We are preparing for even more active defense. We use all opportunities - both internal and external. Necessarily.\n\nI emphasize once again: hard battles lie ahead. Now we cannot think that we have already passed all the tests. We all strive for victory. But when it comes everyone will see it. Everyone will feel that peace is coming.\n\nIn the afternoon I spoke with President of France Macron. About the humanitarian situation in the Ukrainian cities shelled by the occupiers. The situation in Mariupol was discussed separately. For which, I hope, there may still be a solution. Europe has no right to react in silence to what is happening in our Mariupol. The whole world must react to this humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nToday humanitarian corridors worked in three regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia. 6,266 people were rescued. In particular, 3,071 people from Mariupol.\n\nWe are separately agreeing on the removal of the wounded and dead from the city. Our military, our civilians - all citizens. We are talking about this with Turkey as a mediator. Hopefully I will be able to report the details soon.\n\nIn the afternoon I met with President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola. Met in Kyiv. I am grateful to her for this important visit, which demonstrates to some other politicians that courage at a time like this is one of the most important traits for a politician. We talked about how to accelerate Ukraine's accession to the European Union. There are specifics. We also talked about arms supplies and support of European parliamentarians in this. And also about the sanctions policy. About a deeper sanctions policy against Russia. Because if there is an embargo, then it is an embargo. If there is SWIFT, then it is for all banks. And if it is business with Russia, it is not just a suspension of activities, but a complete withdrawal of European companies from the Russian market.\n\nTraditionally, I signed a decree on awarding our defenders. Seven servicemen of the State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection. Two of them - posthumously.\n\nEternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to our defenders!\n\nAnd finally. Tomorrow, April 2, Ukrainian Muslims together with all Muslims of the world will celebrate the holy month of Ramadan. Sincere prayers, mutual forgiveness and good deeds characterize this month. But in Ukraine, another virtue is added - loyalty to brothers-in-arms and your people in battles.\n\nIn the battles for the freedom of Ukraine. In our war for independence. In which we will definitely win. We will definitely achieve peace. For our entire land.\n\n**I sincerely wish you peace! Everyone. The whole of Ukraine! All the people of the world.**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"I emphasize once again: hard battles lie ahead. Now we cannot think that we have already passed all the tests.

It’s hard to believe that, but March has already passed. Absolutely imperceptible!\n\nThe passage of time is somehow not even noticed. Every day and every night has become virtually the same for us. The same day, the same night.\n\nAnd with one task for all - to protect ourselves, save people, rebuff invaders. Drive them out.\n\nAll this March and five days of February, the invaders have been trying to break in and gain a foothold in our house from different directions - from land, from the sky, from the sea. They go, fly, swim... There is so much evil in them, so much thirst for destruction that it reminds not of people, but of something otherworldly. Some monsters that burn and loot, attack and try to kill. Some hellish chimeras.\n\nBut when you are on your land, everything helps you. The land itself, rivers, every person. Everyone, even the one you didn't expect from before. We endured much more than the enemy expected.\n\nThey said - three or five days. They thought that this would be enough for them to seize our entire state. And it’s already 36. And we are standing. And we will continue to fight. Until the end.\n\nUntil we have strength and opportunities.\n\nSo that there are no monsters left on our land. So that if chimeras (points to the House with Chimeras - ed.), then native and good. The ones protecting us.\n\nI am sure that it is extremely pleasant for each of you to read and watch the news that Ukrainian cities are gradually being liberated from the occupiers.\n\nAnd so it is. Our Armed Forces, the National Police and the National Guard, intelligence are doing great. Absolute gratitude to them!\n\nTo the north of Kyiv, in the Chernihiv direction, in the Sumy region, the expulsion of the occupiers continues. They themselves are aware that they can no longer withstand the intensity of hostilities they could have maintained in the first half of March.\n\nBut we must also realize that for the Russian military, this is part of their tactics. All this is not occasional. We know their plans. We know what they are planning and what they are doing.\n\nWe know that they are moving away from the areas where we are beating them to focus on others that are very important. On those where it can be difficult for us.\n\nThat is why it is very important for everyone to show restraint. Restraint in emotions. Restraint in worries. We all equally want to win. Equally!\n\nBut there will be battles ahead. We still have a very difficult path to cover to get everything we strive for.\n\nOf course, everyone should motivate our military, each other, and support our defense. Children - with \"likes\". Parents - with a warm word. Volunteers - with help. The people and the state - with all the resources and opportunities that we have, that are available in Ukraine.\n\nRestraint in emotions, readiness to fight until we win and proper motivation for our military are essential elements.\n\nI also work on motivation for them. Daily. Like each of us.\n\nAs always, before delivering the address, I signed a decree awarding our heroes. 136 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Thank you to everyone!\n\nAnd today another decision was made. Regarding antiheroes. Now I do not have time to deal with all the traitors. But gradually they will all be punished.\n\nThat is why the ex-chief of the Main Department of Internal Security of the Security Service of Ukraine Naumov Andriy Olehovych and the former head of the Office of the Security Service of Ukraine in the Kherson region Kryvoruchko Serhiy Oleksandrovych are no longer generals.\n\nAccording to Article 48 of the Disciplinary Statute of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, those servicemen among senior officers who have not decided where their homeland is, who violate the military oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people as regards the protection of our state, its freedom and independence, will inevitably be deprived of senior military ranks. Random generals don't belong here!\n\nAnd to the real heroes of the Security Service - the same absolute gratitude, just as to each and everyone who sincerely defends our state. There are really a lot of heroes among the servicemen. We are grateful to them!\n\nThe situation in the south and in Donbas remains extremely difficult.\n\nThe invaders are allocating their sick creativity to the temporarily occupied areas of the Kherson region. They are trying to organize some of their incomprehensible structures there, they are trying to figure out how to consolidate their presence there.\n\nOf course, this is hopeless for them. The more active they are there, the more substantial the losses of Russia itself will be in the end. The losses of Russians themselves. Because who else will pay for the occupation of a foreign land?\n\nAlso in Donbas, in Mariupol, in the Kharkiv direction, Russian troops are accumulating the potential for strikes. Powerful strikes. We will defend ourselves. We will do everything we can to stop the occupiers and clear our land of their evil and foolish chimeras.\n\nToday I addressed the parliaments of our partner countries: Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium. I felt total support. I am waiting for concrete steps. I called for tougher sanctions against Russia. We have to put pressure on the aggressor until the aggression is over.\n\nI also spoke about this with President of the European Council Charles Michel. We need more support from our partners right now. When the Russian military is concentrating additional forces in certain areas.\n\nIn addition to sanctions, we discussed with Charles Michel economic support for Ukraine, financing of priority projects. The dynamics of our movement towards full membership in the EU.\n\nThe sanctions policy was one of the topics of conversation between Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak and US National Security Advisor Jacob Sullivan.\n\nThe United States has imposed a new package of sanctions against Russia. We are grateful. It will not allow the current sanctions to be circumvented - we have already noticed such attempts. It will also limit the work of sensitive sectors of the Russian economy - its defense sector.\n\nLet Moscow not forget that the sanctions policy will only be continued and intensified. As long as there is no peace - sanctions are needed. Until Russia begins to invest as sincerely in the search for peace as it invests in the destruction of our state, sanctions will remain unalterable.\n\nI also held talks with President of Turkey Erdoğan today. We spoke very specifically. In particular, about the prospects of negotiations in Turkey with the Russian Federation. And also about the creation of an effective system of guarantees for our state. About the security we have always needed and to the real provision of which we have come closer. I am grateful for Turkey's readiness to become a guarantor of security for Ukraine.\n\nAnd finally. Both I and government officials have already said that the \"Diia\" state service has started accepting applications for compensation for the destroyed real estate of our citizens. The state will return to our people everything that the occupiers destroyed - houses, apartments, etc.\n\nIn a few days, 25,491 applications have already been submitted. The number of residents in these houses and these apartments, which were destroyed, according to our estimates is 63 thousand 471 people. But we know that more needs to be restored. Much more.\n\nSo tell everyone who needs it about such a government program. An important program. The opportunity to submit applications will soon be available offline, in the administrative service centers, in the mode usual for many Ukrainians.\n\nNo matter what, we all have to think about the future. About what Ukraine will be like after this war. How we will live. Because this is a war for our future. This is a war for our lives, in which we have only one way - to gain peace for Ukraine. To gain Ukraine's security.\n\n**Glory to all our heroes!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Every day and every night has become virtually the same for us. The same day, the same night.
