Strong and kind! But – kind NOT to enemies.\n\nWe are a nation that broke the enemy's plans in a week. Plans that have been built for years. Treacherously. Deliberately. With hatred of our country, of our people - of any people who have heart and freedom. But we stopped them. We beat them. Our military, border guards, territorial defense. Even ordinary farmers capture the Russian military on a daily basis. And they all say one thing: they don't know why they're here. Despite the fact that their quantity is ten times bigger, the morale of the enemy is deteriorating. More and more invaders are fleeing back to Russia. From us. From you. From all who drive out the enemy with javelins, stugnas, guns, tanks, planes, helicopters. Everything that shoots.\n\nBut Ukrainians are beating the enemy even without weapons. I sincerely admire the heroic civilians of Konotop, Bashtanka, Energodar, Melitopol. Other towns and villages. Who do not let the invaders in by blocking the roads. People come out in front of enemy vehicles. This is extremely dangerous. But this is brave. It is also salvation. I'm sure you saw a video from Melitopol where Ukrainians protested against Russians who entered our city. Temporarily. I am sure of this: if they entered somewhere, it is only temporarily. We’ll drive them out. With shame. As those people, ordinary people who drive the invaders out of grocery stores when the Russian soldiers are trying to find food do. These are not warriors of the superpower. These are confused children who were used. Take them home.\n\nUkrainians! Every invader should know: they will not get anything here. No one will be conquered. Even if they can accumulate more equipment and more people, it doesn't change anything for them. Wherever they enter. They will be destroyed everywhere. They will not have peace. They will have no food. They will not have a single quiet moment. The invaders will receive only a rebuff from Ukrainians. Fierce rebuff. Such a rebuff that they will forever remember that we will not give up what’s ours. That they will remember what the patriotic war is. Yes, for us it is a patriotic war. We remember how patriotic wars begin. And we know how they end. For the invaders.\n\nOur army is doing everything to break the enemy completely. Almost nine thousand Russians were killed! In one week! In the Mykolaiv direction invaders have to take away the \"two hundred\" and \"three hundred\" with tens of helicopters. 19 years, 20 years ... What did they see in life, apart from this invasion? But most of them remain everywhere. Ukraine does not want to be covered with military corpses. Go home. Your whole army. Tell your commanders that you want to live. Not to die. To live. The war must be stopped and peace restored as soon as possible.\n\nToday was, as usual, an active day of negotiations with the leaders of the member states of our anti-war coalition. I held talks with the heads of government of Norway and Israel. With the President of Kazakhstan. With the Emir of Qatar **Tamim Bin Hamad al Thani**. With President of the European Council **Charles Michel**. With Prime Minister of Canada **Justin Trudeau**. With President of Poland *Andrzej Duda**. Brilliant result at the UN General Assembly. 141 countries supported the resolution, which calls on Russia to withdraw troops from Ukraine immediately. 141 states stand for us! And for Russia - only four states that voted against. Here is the list: North Korea, Eritrea, Syria and Belarus. This is the list. These are the friends. And there will be no others for the state that does not know how to live in peace.\n\nToday I held a meeting with the heads of regions and cities of Ukraine. The new head of the Odesa regional state administration is already working. Maksym Marchenko. Military. Professional. Our guys on the ground are working hard to organize \"green corridors\". To take out civilians. To bring medicine. Volnovakha, cities of the Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv regions, south of Ukraine. This is very difficult. Extremely difficult. We are opposed by terror. But terror loses. Thanks to our heroes.\n\nToday I signed a decree awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to fifteen of our defenders:\n\n**Senior Lieutenant Maksym Vitaliyovych Bilokon**. Posthumously. He took part in repelling the enemy's attack during the defense of Chernihiv, destroyed the enemy's subversive group and two enemy tanks.\n\n**Lieutenant Colonel Oleksandr Valeriyovych Kapichun**. Posthumously. Thanks to his heroic actions, the enemy column was stopped, equipment and enemy soldiers were destroyed.\n\n**Soldier Oleksandr Volodymyrovych Lukyanovych**. Posthumously. During the battle he neutralized up to three dozen units of enemy equipment. He was fatally wounded by an air strike.\n\n**Junior Sergeant Mykhailo Mykhailovych Nesolyony**. Posthumously. He died in close combat with enemy forces while evacuating people.\n\n**Soldier Andriy Valeriyovych Nikonchuk**. Posthumously. He protected the Kyiv HPP from Russian air raids and missile strikes.\n\n**Lieutenant Vitalii Romanoviyh Sapyl**. Posthumously. Tank platoon commander. Neutralized three dozen enemy vehicles. Killed by an air strike.\n\n**Chief Sergeant Oleksiy Oleksandrovych Senyuk**. Posthumously. He defended Chernihiv, destroyed two enemy IFVs and captured a T-72 tank. Killed by an air strike.\n\n**Lieutenant Vladyslav Petrovych Ukrainets**. Posthumously. He covered the retreat of brothers-in-arms when the enemy attacked.\n\n**Major Stepan Ivanovych Choban**. Posthumously. The pilot of the Su-27, distracted the enemy aircraft over Kropyvnytskyi.\n\n**Major Ihor Vasyliovych Mykhalchuk**. Head of the tank battalion unit. Destroyed numerous enemy armored vehicles.\n\n**Colonel Serhiy Mykolayovych Musienko**. Head of the Missile and Artillery Division. Inflicted devastating blows on the enemy in the Kharkiv direction.\n\n**Lieutenant Yevhen Mykhailovych Palchenko**. Tank platoon commander. Covered the exit of the brigade from the encirclement.\n\n**Major Vladyslav Yuriyovych Prokopenko**. Head of the tank battalion. Withdrew personnel and equipment from the encirclement without loss.\n\n**Lieutenant Colonel Pavlo Yuriyovych Fedosenko**. Head of the unit of the 92nd brigade. For the effective defense of Kharkiv.\n\n**Senior Lieutenant Dmytro Petrovych Chavalakh**. For heroic participation in the defense of the Kherson region.\n\nAll 40 million are like these fifteen heroes!\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"«Кожен окупант повинен знати: вони отримають від українців люту відсіч.

I did not accidentally say \"united\". The seventh day of this terrible war began. A war we feel the same way. During this time we have had more unity than for over thirty years before. At first we were equally scared, then we felt equally painful. And now we do not care. Except for victory. Except for the truth. Except for peace. Except for the tranquility we want to achieve. Except for the lives of our people, for whom we are worried. Except for Ukraine. During this time, we have truly become one. We forgave each other a lot. We started loving each other. We help each other. We are worried for each other. Yesterday morning on Freedom Square we were all Kharkiv residents. Then the enemy destroyed us all by striking at residential buildings in Borodyanka. We were all bombed in Kyiv last night. And we all died again in Babyn Yar - from a missile strike. Although the whole world promises constantly - never again.\n\nFor any normal person who knows history, Babyn Yar is a special part of Kyiv. A special part of Europe. A place of prayer. A place of remembrance for the hundred thousand people killed by the Nazis. The place of old Kyiv cemeteries. Who should you be to make it a target for missiles? You are killing Holocaust victims for the second time. During the Soviet era, a TV center was built on the bones there. And also a sports complex. Outbuildings. They built a park there. To erase the true history of Babyn Yar. But why was it bombed? This is beyond humanity. Such a missile strike shows that for many people in Russia, our Kyiv is completely foreign. They know nothing about our capital. About our history. But they have an order to erase our history. Erase our country. Erase us all. On the first day of the war, Uman was brutally bombed, where hundreds of thousands of Jews come every year to pray. Then - Babyn Yar, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were executed. I am now addressing all the Jews of the world - don't you see what is happening? That is why it is very important that millions of Jews around the world do not remain silent right now. Nazism is born in silence. So shout about the killings of civilians. Shout about the killings of Ukrainians.\n\nLast night and tonight they continued to bomb our cities. Bombs. Missiles. Artillery. Machine guns. Targeting peaceful people. Again. Targeting residential areas. Again. Mariupol, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Zhytomyr and other cities and towns of Ukraine. This cannot be explained by any human reason. Any reason of God. What then, if Babyn Yar was attacked? What other military facilities threaten Russia? What other “NATO bases”? Saint Sophia Cathedral? Lavra? St. Andrew's Church? Whatever they dream of there - damn them! Because God is with us!\n\nDuring this time, we have united the European Union already on a new level. Higher than formal. Higher than interstate. At the level of ordinary people. Millions and millions of Europeans. From the Atlantic Ocean to the suburbs of Kharkiv, where fierce fighting continues. When the European Parliament stood and applauded us, our struggle, it was an assessment of our efforts. Our unity. Six days of war like thirty years. That is why the European Union answers \"yes\" to us. We have started a special accelerated accession procedure. Our diplomats and our friends unite the world for the sake of Ukraine and peace even more. Neutral Switzerland has supported EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs, officials, the state and companies. Once again: neutral Switzerland! So what do some other countries expect? Our anti-war coalition has already been joined by the countries that Moscow relied on a week ago. This is an extraordinary result. You can't stay neutral right now!\n\nAnd what is the result for Russia? The flag of this state will no longer be seen in sports tournaments. Modern world culture will now be closed to them. Russian goods are being removed from store shelves around the world. Russian banks are disconnected from the global system. Russian citizens are losing their savings, losing all prospects. Russian mothers are losing their children in a completely foreign country. Think of this number: almost six thousand Russians died. Russian military. In six days of war. This is without counting the losses of the enemy last night. Six thousand. To get what? Get Ukraine? It is impossible. This is not to be changed by missiles. Bombs. Tanks. Any blows. We are on our native land. And for the war against us there will be an International Tribunal for them.\n\nUkrainians! Another night of Russia's full-scale war against us, against the people, has passed. Hard night. Someone spent that night in the subway - in a shelter. Someone spent it in the basement. Someone was luckier and slept at home. Others were sheltered by friends and relatives. We’ve hardly slept for seven nights. Or we sleep, but anxiously. My dears, the time will come when we will be able to sleep. But it will be after the war. After the victory. In a peaceful country, as we need. Which we have always appreciated. And which we have never destroyed. I ask all of you to take care of your loved ones. Take care of your brothers-in-arms. I admire you! The whole world admires you. From Hollywood stars to politicians. Today you, Ukrainians, are a symbol of invincibility. A symbol that people in any country can become the best people on earth at any moment.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n",description:"Address by the President: Ukrainians are a symbol of invincibility",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVRZNGFXF0Y"},{id:"UgacKdlj6HQ",name:"Президент України Володимир Зеленський дав інтерв’ю журналістам CNN і Reuters",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-01T22:15:56",text:"Президент України Володимир Зеленський дав інтерв’ю журналістам CNN і Reuters",description:"Президент України Володимир Зеленський дав інтерв’ю журналістам CNN і Reuters",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgacKdlj6HQ"},{id:"FdovXexNqnM",name:"Ворог атакував столицю!

A cruise missile strike. At the largest square of Europe. Freedom Square. Dozens of victims. This is what the price of freedom is. This is what the morning of the people of Ukraine is.\n\nUkrainian Kharkiv and Russian Belgorod have always been close cities. In many ways. Even the border between them was only conditional, only on maps, but not in the soul. Not in the soul. Now everything has changed. After the cruise missile that struck Kharkiv from Belgorod. The missile that hit Freedom Square. The face of our Kharkiv. This is terror against the city. There was no military target on the square. Just as in those residential areas of Kharkiv hit by rocket artillery. The rocket aimed at the central square is an outright, undisguised terror. No one will forgive. No one will forget.\n\nThis attack on Kharkiv is a war crime. This is state terrorism of the Russian Federation. After that, Russia is a terrorist state. Obviously. And it must be official. We call on all countries of the world to respond immediately and effectively to this criminal tactic of the aggressor and to declare that Russia is committing state terrorism. We demand full responsibility for terrorists in international courts.\n\nKharkiv and Kyiv are currently the most important targets for Russia. Terror is meant to break us. To break our resistance. They are heading to our capital, as well as to Kharkiv. Therefore, the defense of the capital today is the key priority for the state. All cities of Ukraine must do everything to stop the enemy. The military and civilian authorities of each city are responsible for this. But Kyiv is special. If we protect Kyiv, we will protect the state. This is the heart of our country. And it must keep beating. And it will keep beating. So that life triumphs.\n\nDear Kyiv residents! Defense of the capital is above all. That's why I decided to appoint a professional military person as the Head of the Kyiv City Military Administration for the period of war. To guarantee the defense of the city. To block the enemy's approaches to our capital. To ensure that the people of Kyiv have everything they need. The Head of the Military Administration will be General Mykola Mykolayovych Zhyrnov, who served as commander of the support forces. At a high level he organized the engineering support of combat operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2014-2015. He is currently a state expert of the Military Security Service at the National Security and Defense Council. Vitali Klitschko remains mayor of Kyiv. He will have his own sphere of responsibility. And now it is a joint work of the mayor and the Head of the Military Administration. After the war, we will return everything to its place in the capital.\n\nRegarding our diplomats. Right now, our diplomats are implementing fair and absolutely necessary decisions in relation to those states that have betrayed their word and international law. We immediately recall the Ambassador from Kyrgyzstan for consultations. For justifying aggression against Ukraine. We immediately recall the Ambassador from Georgia. For the obstacles to volunteers who want to help us. For an immoral attitude towards sanctions.\n\nAnd now I want to speak about those whose feat is an example of the highest moral strength. These are our doctors. You save people around the clock. Always. And now your work is one of the key lines of our defense. You keep it brilliant. Thousands of lives have been saved in 5 days. I am also grateful to everyone who provides our people with everything they need for life in these extremely difficult conditions. Food, energy, medicine. And I thank the ordinary people of Ukraine, who stop tanks with their bare hands, expel the invaders from administrative buildings by force of spirit and make their stay in Ukraine shameful. To prove that they are all strangers here. This is what the people's war is. This is what the people of Ukraine is.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"The missile at the central square of Kharkiv is terrorism, and Russia must be held accountable for this in international courts - Address by the President of Ukraine.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opcPsPcaPOA"},{id:"ZbrSG0CMXak",name:"Звернення Президента України Володимира Зеленського",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-02-28T23:40:40",topics:["Ракетний удар","Воєнний злочин","Оборона Києва","Відкликання дипломатів","Приєднання до ЄС"],cities:["Харків","Київ"],text:"\nRussian forces today brutally shelled Kharkiv with rocket artillery. This is definitely a military crime. A peaceful city. Peaceful residential areas. No military object. Dozens of eyewitness records prove that this is not a separate false shot, it is a conscious destruction of people. Russians knew where they were shooting.\n\nFor this crime there will definitely be a tribunal. International. This is a breach of all conventions. No one in the world will forgive you the murder of peaceful Ukrainian people. Here is Ukraine. Here is Europe. Here is 2022. Evil, armed with rockets, bombs and artillery, must be stopped immediately. Destroyed economically. We must show that humanity is able to protect themselves. I believe that it is necessary to consider the full closure of the sky for Russian missiles, airplanes, helicopters. In five days of invasion, already 56 missile strikes have been carried out against Ukraine. 113 cruise missiles were fired. This is their \"fraternal friendship\". And the world knows what to do. I spoke about this with partners today.\n\nThe state committing military crimes against civilians cannot be a member of the UN Security Council. The entrance to all ports, channels, airports in the world must be closed for this state . Such a state must not receive hundreds of billions for energy exports. Buying Russian goods now is to pay money for murdering people.\n\nPeaceful, proud, strong Kharkiv. You have always been such. You will always be such. We will withstand this as well. We will defend Ukraine. We will help everyone affected by inhuman invasion. Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Sumy, Hostomel, Vasylkiv, Kherson, Mariupol, Donetsk and all other cities and towns of our native country will see a peaceful and safe life. Sincere condolences to all who lost their relatives and loved ones in this war. Eternal memory to those who died. Eternal glory to everyone who defends our freedom!\n\nBefore addressing you, I signed a decree on awarding the title of the Hero of Ukraine to twelve our defenders:\n\n* **Lieutenant Colonel Eduard Mykolayovych Vahorovsky** (posthumously). He died saving our aircraft from a missile strike. Gave others the opportunity to take to the air. \n* **Major Dmytro Valeriyovych Kolomiets** (posthumously). He rescued his brothers-in-arms, diverted enemy aircraft fire and was shot down by an enemy plane.\n* **Lieutenant Colonel Hennadiy Vasyliovych Matulyak** (posthumously). Hostomel. Destroyed the group of enemy equipment.\n* **Lieutenant Vitaliy Anatoliyovych Movchan** (posthumously). In an air battle he destroyed two enemy aircraft.\n* **Colonel Oleksandr Yakovych Oksanchenko** (posthumously). He died in an air battle, distracting enemy aircraft.\n* **Senior Lieutenant Vyacheslav Denysovych Radionov** (posthumously). Thanks to his courageous actions, the entire crew of the brigade's planes took to the air in Vasylkiv, and this saved ours from a missile strike.\n* **Senior Lieutenant Andriy Andriyovych Gerus**. Over the city of Kropyvnytskyi he shot down an enemy IL-76, which prevented the landing of Russian troops with weapons.\n* **Brigadier General Dmytro Serhiyovych Krasylnykov**, Commander of the Operational and Tactical Group \"North\". For two days he has been fighting off the continuous assault, saved people and equipment. And did not let the enemy into Kharkiv from the Luhansk region.\n* **Lieutenant Colonel Andriy Mykolayovych Kruhlov**. He withdrew the Buk SAM unit from the enemy attacks and personally destroyed two Russian helicopters and one plane.\n* **Colonel Oleksandr Volodymyrovych Mostov**. He shot down a Russian IL-76 near Vasylkiv, as well as two Mi-24 helicopters, which prevented the landing of paratroopers and weapons.\n* **Lieutenant General Yuri Ivanovych Sodol**. In the battles for Volnovakha, he saved our men from the encirclement and organized a successful counterattack. He brought people out of the enemy’s attack. Defends Mariupol extremely effectively.\n* **Colonel of medical service Eduard Mykolayovych Khoroshun**. He personally organized the defense of the besieged military medical center and carried out the evacuation of the wounded.\n\nNow about Kyiv, our beautiful capital, the basis of our state, our security. For an enemy, Kyiv is the key target. They want to break our national statehood. Therefore, the capital is constantly in danger. Three rocket-bombing strikes are carried out only today. TETs-6 is the target. They want to damage a power station and leave our city without light. We did not allow them to break the defense of the capital. And they send saboteurs to us. Constantly. Hundreds. All they are being neutralized.\n\nIn addition to defense, we are thinking about the rear as well. Provide people with everything necessary. We formed a round-the-clock coordination headquarters that collects all requests from regional administrations regarding the lack of the most necessary stuff. Products, medicines, fuel, equipment. The headquarters directly  finds suppliers that can quickly and qualitatively meet such needs. This is the restoration of supply chains, interrupted by the war.\n\nToday, at the initiative of the Russian side, the first round of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia took place. These negotiations took place against the background of bombing and shelling of our territory, our cities. Synchronization of shelling with a negotiation process could be seen. I believe that Russia is trying to put pressure on us in such a way. Don't waste time. We do not perceive such tactics. Fair negotiations are possible when one side does not hit the other side with rocket artillery precisely at the moment of negotiations.\n\nSo far we do not have the result we would like to get. Russia has declared its position. We have outlined positions in response - to end the war. Some signals we received. When the delegation returns to Kyiv, we will analyze what we’ve heard and then determine how to move to the second round of negotiations.\n\nAnother thing that is very important to say. We've been waiting 30 years for this. Today I signed an application for Ukraine's membership in the European Union. We have gained the right to be together with everyone in Europe. The application has already been delivered to Brussels, officially registered. The time has come.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbrSG0CMXak"},{id:"l5XTh2DSZCE",name:"Брифінг Прем’єр-міністра України Дениса Шмигаля",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Денис Шмигаль"],date:"2022-02-28T19:14:03",text:"Брифінг Прем’єр-міністра України Дениса Шмигаля",description:"Брифінг Прем’єр-міністра України Дениса Шмигаля",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5XTh2DSZCE"},{id:"mRwkk2mgfnU",name:"Stand firm: Address by the President of Ukraine",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-02-28T12:17:17",topics:["Поранені діти","Воєнний злочин","Приєднання до ЄС","Звільнення з-під варти"],cities:["Ялта","Євпаторія","Судак","Сімферополь"],text:"\nGood morning, Ukrainian heroes! The fifth day of Russia's full-scale war against the people of Ukraine. We stand firm. During this time, we have experienced as much as other nations may not have in decades. We have been told for a long time that there is something wrong with Ukrainians in this or that issue. That Ukrainians have to do so-called \"homework\" for decades. Because of this, we often did not notice what we are really capable of. And now we have shown ourselves to the fullest. And it's inspiring. For everyone.\n\nIn every conversation with our partners, I hear sincere respect. Ukrainians have shown the world who we are. And Russia has shown what it has become. Just think about it: during the Russian invasion - in just four days - sixteen Ukrainian children died as a result of the Russian shelling. Sixteen! 45 children were wounded.\n\nEvery crime, every shelling that the invaders commit against us, unites us and our partners even more. Russia did not believe in such a solidary and powerful reaction. But Ukrainians have changed that story. The European Union has decided to supply us with weapons. We are grateful. Yesterday I spoke with Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, about further, even stronger steps. Europeans are aware that our soldiers are fighting for our country and, consequently, for the whole of Europe. For peace for all European countries, for the lives of children, for equality, for democracy. And this gives us the full right to do the following.\n\nWe appeal to the European Union for Ukraine's immediate accession under a new special procedure. We are grateful to our partners for being with us. But our goal is to be with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be equal. I am confident that is fair. I am confident we deserve it. I am confident that all this is possible.\n\nYesterday I spoke with the Presidents of Portugal, Lithuania, President of France Emmanuel Macron and President of Poland Andrzej Duda. I am especially grateful to Andrzej Duda for our fruitful work. I spoke with the Prime Ministers of Belgium, Spain and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. Support of our anti-war coalition is unconditional and unprecedented.\n\nEurope has closed the sky to all Russian planes. Global business refuses any ties with Russian companies. Let's see how this week will end for the Russian currency - what will be the fall of the ruble. As long as this criminal invasion of Ukraine continues, the Russian state is suffering losses as if the war passed through their territory. Do you need all this? Russian mothers, Russian teachers, Russian entrepreneurs, ordinary people. For what?\n\nFour and a half thousand Russian soldiers have already been killed. Why did you all come here? Why do the columns of your armored vehicles go against us? From our Crimea. From Yalta, Yevpatoriya, Sudak, Simferopol... These are not the names of military camps for tankers. Once again: four and a half thousand Russian invaders killed. Throw away your equipment. And leave. Do not believe your commanders. Do not believe your propagandists. Just save your lives. Leave.\n\nWe dedicate every hour to strengthening our state. Anyone who can join the fight against the invaders must do so. Therefore, a decision was made - not easy from a moral point of view, but useful from the point of view of our protection. Under martial law, participants in hostilities - Ukrainians with real combat experience - will be released from custody and will be able to compensate for their guilt in the hottest spots of war. All sanctions are lifted from some people who took part in the anti-terrorist operation. The key now is defense.\n\nWhen I ran for presidency, I said that each of us is the President. Because we are all responsible for our state. For our beautiful Ukraine. And now it turns out that each of us is a warrior. The warrior in his or her own place.

We haven\'t spoken to him in two years. And today I had a long substantive conversation with him.\n\nI explained to him in detail the impossibility of our clash. I do not want missiles, planes, helicopters to fly to Ukraine from Belarus. I do not want troops to go to Ukraine from Belarus. And he assured me of that.\n\nMy task as President is to protect our state. And you have seen during these tough days how we are fulfilling this task.\n\nAlexander Lukashenko called on the meeting of the Ukrainian and Russian delegations on the Pripyat River. I emphasize: without any conditions.\n\nI will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as President, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance.\n\nAnd while our guys are there, the President is here, the Head of the Office is here, the Prime Minister is here, the army is here, the Commander-in-Chief is here. We will all defend our state and our borders.\n\nYou and I must act pragmatically to achieve our goal. And our goal is our territorial integrity. You have seen our position one hundred percent. This is the unconditional protection of national statehood.\n\nAs regards our motivation. It is obvious that our servicemen are fighting not for money, but for today, for tomorrow. And they provide a very tough response to what happened yesterday.\n\nBut we must understand that today the most important job is to be a soldier, to defend the country. And that\'s why I really want the state to pay decently for this job.\n\nWe will pay our armed servicemen a hundred thousand hryvnias a month. Not to hear "thank you" from them, but to let them know that the country is definitely grateful to them. And it will be so until this war is over.\n\nAnd the last thing. Yesterday, unfortunately, we lost our "Mriya". But the old "Mriya". And we are building a new one now.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ',description:"I do not want missiles, planes, helicopters to fly to Ukraine from Belarus.

What do they do? This is revenge. The people rose to defend their state, and they showed their true faces. This is terror.\n\nThey are going to bomb our Ukrainian cities even more. They are going to kill our children even more insidiously. This is an evil that has come to our land and must be destroyed.\n\nThey lied that they would not touch the civilian population. But since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.\n\nThey consciously chose tactics to destroy people and everything that makes life just normal. Power plants, hospitals, kindergartens, residential buildings - all this is under attack every day.\n\nWhat the invaders are doing to Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, Kyiv, Odesa and other cities and towns deserves an international tribunal. We clearly record all their crimes. And there would have been many more of these crimes if it hadn't been for our courageous defenders.\n\nUkrainian forces are great. Repulse attacks, breaking the enemy's plans. They do their job brilliantly.\n\nYes, this is truly a job. A hard, fundamental, and most importantly - fair job. A job that deserves the highest appraisal and the highest gratitude. A decision was made to significantly increase the payments to our defenders. I can honestly say that it will be expensive. But there is nothing more precious than life and the struggle for our freedom and freedom of our next generations.\n\nAnd there are those who will help us. This is already real. We get weapons, medicine, food, diesel, money. A strong international coalition in support of Ukraine has been formed. An anti-war coalition.\n\nHere is the latest summary from the diplomatic frontline. There were very substantive talks with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the President of Georgia, the Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Johnson. Each conversation added specifics to the defense capabilities of our state and the strength of our military.\n\nGermany has announced the supply of 1,000 anti-tank grenade launchers and 500 Stingers with additional ammunition. Belgium provides 5,000 machine guns and 5 million rounds of ammunition, and another 4,000 tons of fuel.\n\nThanks to active diplomacy, we’ve convinced all European countries to disconnect Russia from SWIFT. We thank President of Poland Andrzej Duda for his personal leadership in granting Ukraine membership in the European Union. Poland's daily assistance to our country is also very much needed.\n\nWe have to call a spade a spade. Russia's criminal actions against Ukraine show signs of genocide. I talked about this with the UN Secretary General. Russia is on the path of evil. The world must deprive Russia of the right to vote in the UN Security Council.\n\nUkrainians! We know exactly what we are defending. We will definitely win.\n\n**Glory to each of our soldiers!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"What the invaders are doing to Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, Kyiv, Odesa and other cities and towns deserves an international tribunal.

This could look like a normal political process. But now it certainly cannot be anything normal.\n\nNow decisions are made on a completely different level.\n\nLast night in Ukraine was cruel. More shelling. More bombing of residential areas, civilian infrastructure. Today there is not a single object in the country that the invaders would not consider a valid target for themselves. They fight against everyone. They fight against everything that’s alive - against kindergartens, against residential buildings and even against ambulances. They use rocket artillery, missiles against entire urban areas in which there has never been any military infrastructure.\n\nVasylkiv, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and many other cities of Ukraine are surviving in conditions that were last seen on our land and your land during the Second World War.\n\nBut in the war that is going on now, you are not on the same side with us. Regretfully. From your territory, the troops of the Russian Federation launch rockets into Ukraine. Our children are being killed from your territory, our houses are being destroyed, they are trying to blow up everything that has been built over decades - and, by the way, not only by us, but also by our fathers, our grandfathers.\n\nAnd all this is also a de facto referendum for you, Belarusians. You decide who you are. You decide who to be. How will you look into the eyes of your children, how will you look into the eyes of each other, your neighbors. And we are your neighbors. We, Ukrainians. Be Belarus, not Russia! You are making this choice right now. Exactly today.\n\nNow there is a lot of news about possible negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, which can end this war and restore peace to all of us. And they often mention your capital. Minsk. As a platform for these negotiations. A place we didn't choose. And, in fact, you did not, too.The leadership of Russia chose it. And now, there is an offer to meet there again.\n\nFour days ago, cruise missiles, planes, helicopters and equipment came from Belarusian territory. They hit our homes, they hit our lives. The heavy equipment followed. And this is a dreadful deja vu. You know, Kyiv was attacked at 4 am. Someone has such a sense of humor, just as in 1941. You slept, Belarusian brothers. And we woke up. But you are still sleeping. And we haven't gone to bed since that moment. Because we are fighting. We are fighting for our country. We are fighting for our freedom. Because we have every right to do so.\n\nIf there were no aggressive actions from your territory, we could speak in Minsk. In your city. When you were neutral, we spoke in Minsk, we met many times. This is right. This is truthful. To talk like neighbors. Right now, you haven't made your big choice yet. And it is ahead, it should depend only on you. Not on Russia, not on Ukraine, not on America, but on the people of Belarus.\n\nThat is why now we say - not Minsk. The venue for the meeting may be other cities. Of course, we want peace. We want to meet, we want the end of the war! Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, Istanbul, Baku - we proposed to the Russian side all of this. Any other city suits us in a country from whose territory missiles are not launched. Only in this way can negotiations be honest. And they can really end the war.\n\nI sincerely wish Belarus to once again become that kind, safe Belarus that everyone saw not so long ago. Make the right choice. I am sure this is the main choice of your great people.\n    ",description:"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the citizens of Belarus",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwkFfesUFxY"},{id:"7ZHUyOBpQi4",name:"Брифінг Прем’єр-міністра України Дениса Шмигаля",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Денис Шмигаль"],date:"2022-02-26T21:11:24",text:"Ситуація щодо російського вторгнення – брифінг Прем’єр-міністра України Дениса Шмигаля.",description:"Ситуація щодо російського вторгнення – брифінг Прем’єр-міністра України Дениса Шмигаля.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZHUyOBpQi4"},{id:"3pg-K1pMsqM",name:"Брифінг радника керівника Офісу Президента Олексія Арестовича",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Олексій Арестович"],date:"2022-02-26T21:06:06",text:"Ситуація щодо російського вторгнення – брифінг радника керівника Офісу Президента Олексія Арестовича.",description:"Ситуація щодо російського вторгнення – брифінг радника керівника Офісу Президента Олексія Арестовича.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pg-K1pMsqM"},{id:"RZIf5oaWKBw",name:"Звернення Президента Володимира Зеленського",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-02-26T21:00:50",text:"«Світ побачив – українці могутні.

We withstood and successfully repel enemy attacks. The fighting continues. In many cities and districts of our state. But we know what we are defending. The country, the land, the future of children.\n\nKyiv and key cities around the capital are controlled by our army. The invaders wanted to block the center of our state and put their puppets here, as in Donetsk. We broke their plan. They did not gain any advantage over us.\n\nOn our streets, in the skies of Kyiv, in Vasylkiv, in Vyshhorod, even in the surrounding fields, a real battle for Kyiv took place. The enemy used everything against us: missiles, fighter aircraft, drones, artillery, armored vehicles, saboteurs, paratroopers. The invaders are shelling residential neighborhoods, including with the use of missile artillery, trying to destroy energy facilities. They have very treacherous tactics.\n\nDwellings destroyed by missiles and artillery are the ultimate argument for the world to stop the occupation invasion together with us.\n\nI say this as frankly as possible now: the people of Ukraine have already earned and have the right to become a member of the European Union. This will be the key evidence of our country's support.\n\nIt is a crucial moment to close the long-standing strategic discussion once and for all and to decide on Ukraine's membership in the European Union. I discussed this today with Charles Michel, Ursula von der Leyen, Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe anti-war coalition is operating - defense weapons and equipment are heading to Ukraine. We already have almost full support from EU countries for disconnecting Russia from SWIFT. I hope that Germany and Hungary will have the courage to support this decision. We have the courage to defend our homeland, to defend Europe.\n\nIn each of our cities, the invaders are being severely rebuffed. Uman, Odesa, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Donbas, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv - wherever the enemy kills our people, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing everything to stop and destroy the invaders. Lviv and other cities in western and central Ukraine that are under air attacks endure firmly. Well done!\n\nEvery Ukrainian needs to remember one thing. If you can stop and destroy the invaders, do it. All those who can return to Ukraine, come back to defend Ukraine. And then we will have a lot of work with you to rebuild it!\n\nAll those who can defend Ukraine abroad, do it purposefully, unitedly, continuously! All friends of Ukraine who want to join the defense - come, we will give you weapons! All the details of how to implement this will be announced in the near future.\n\nGlory to all those who defend Ukraine today! You are heroes!\n\nI adopted a decision to posthumously award the title of Hero of Ukraine to Vitaliy Volodymyrovych Skakun, a sapper of the 35th Separate Marine Brigade. At the cost of his own life, he blew up the bridge.\n\nAnd now I want absolutely everyone in Russia to hear me. Thousands of victims. Hundreds of prisoners who simply cannot understand why they were sent to Ukraine. Sent to be killed. The sooner you tell your government that the war must be stopped immediately, the more of your people will remain alive.\n\nWe see that there are indeed protests by your citizens against the war. We know that many in Russia are now simply shocked by the meanness and cruelty of the authorities. This is a truly correct response. I thank you for this reaction. Thanks to Leonid Parfyonov, Dmitry Muratov, Yury Dud, Liya Akhedzhakova, Valery Meladze and thousands, thousands of other Russians whose conscience is heard loud. Just stop those who lie to you, lie to us, lie to the whole world. We need to end this war. We can live in peace - in global peace, in human peace.\n\nOur military, national guards, national police, territorial defense, border guards, special services, citizens - hold on! We will defeat everyone.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"We withstood: address by the President of Ukraine on the third day of the war",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJRYocGoHWQ"},{id:"wkJjhwKCXiw",name:"Звернення Ірини Верещук до Міжнародного комітету Червоного Хреста.",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Ірина Верещук"],date:"2022-02-26T11:13:07",text:"вернення Ірини Верещук до Міжнародного комітету Червоного Хреста.",description:"вернення Ірини Верещук до Міжнародного комітету Червоного Хреста.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkJjhwKCXiw"},{id:"az2QFR5pJIs",name:"Не вірте фейкам!",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-02-26T08:29:51",text:"Не вірте фейкам!",description:"Не вірте фейкам!",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az2QFR5pJIs"},{id:"w9Ej8IzV4fU",name:"Ситуація щодо російського вторгнення (ранок третього дня) – брифінг Михайла Подоляка ",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Михайло Подоляк"],date:"2022-02-26T08:18:14",text:"Ситуація щодо російського вторгнення (ранок третього дня) – брифінг радника керівника Офісу Президента Михайла Подоляка.",description:"Ситуація щодо російського вторгнення (ранок третього дня) – брифінг радника керівника Офісу Президента Михайла Подоляка.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Ej8IzV4fU"},{id:"p1653ejfNH0",name:"Звернення Президента України ввечері другого дня масштабної війни",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-02-26T06:58:46",text:"«Це був важкий, але сміливий день!» Звернення Президента України ввечері другого дня масштабної війни.",description:"«Це був важкий, але сміливий день!» Звернення Президента України ввечері другого дня масштабної війни.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1653ejfNH0"},{id:"YnbAyPzqEcw",name:"Брифінг Михайла Подоляка та Дениса Шмигаля",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Михайло Подоляк","Денис Шмигаль"],date:"2022-02-25T20:15:28",text:"Брифінг радника керівника Офісу Президента Михайла Подоляка та Прем’єр-міністра України Дениса Шмигаля.",description:"Брифінг радника керівника Офісу Президента Михайла Подоляка та Прем’єр-міністра України Дениса Шмигаля.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbAyPzqEcw"},{id:"3zFAZ4ezNYE",name:"Звернення Президента України Володимира Зеленського",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"https://youtu.be/3zFAZ4ezNYE?t=173",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-02-25T14:18:17",text:"«Вторгнення Росії в Україну – це не просто вторгнення, це початок війни проти Європи».
