These colors are associated with freedom. This is true for different people on different continents. And of course in Europe.\n\nThe blue and yellow colors of the national flag are not just about Ukraine. This is about you as well, about Sweden. And obviously this is not a coincidence. This is fate. Because we are equally for freedom. We are equally for a peaceful life. We are equally for respect for everyone. We are equally for justice and equally for caring for the natural world in which we live. Therefore, it is logical that Sweden is now among those who support Ukraine the most.\n\nAnd I am sincerely grateful to each of you for this.\n\nToday is exactly the month of the worst ordeal - the full-scale war waged by Russia against our state.\n\nEurope has never known such a dark month since World War II. It has not seen such destruction and such war crimes. The list of those killed already reaches thousands. Dozens of our cities and communities were destroyed. Russian troops do not distinguish between civilian and military targets. They destroy everything. They burn residential neighborhoods and houses. They blow up hospitals. They even fire at kindergartens with rocket artillery! Hundreds of educational facilities and more than 200 schools were destroyed. Russian troops bombed universities.\n\nImagine - they destroy any infrastructure that simply serves life. Warehouses with food and medicine. They seized two nuclear power plants. Yesterday they hit the second chemical production already. Phosphorus bombs were used today! Both adults and children were killed.\n\nWhat is the purpose of such actions of Russia? What is the reason of such terror against us?\n\nThis is an attempt to conquer the whole nation. An attempt to make the neighboring state a slave.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**Swedish people!**\n\nModern Europe, which has finally become peaceful, is built on clear principles. Namely: there can be no forced border revision. And every nation has the right to choose its own future - without dictatorship, without coercion, without occupation. Thanks to these two principles, we in Europe have had an unprecedented era of cooperation. Peace. Confidence.\n\nWe had it until the Russian leadership decided that it could travel in time. That it allegedly could cancel the 21st century. Allegedly could act as in the old days of totalitarian ideologies.\n\nIf Ukraine failed to endure, defend itself, it would mean that everything we, living and modern people, value was lost. Everything you value. Everything that is valued by any free people of any state. This would mean that all of Russia's neighbors are in danger. This would mean that you are in danger, because only the sea separates you from this aggressive policy of this state.\n\nAnd Russian propagandists are already discussing on state television how Russia is occupying your Gotland island in particular. And how to keep it under control for decades. They show it to the Russians on the map, show the directions of the offensive... You may ask for what purpose? They say it will be beneficial for Russia to deploy air defense systems and a military base in Gotland. To cover the capture of the Baltic states.\n\nRussia went to war against Ukraine because it expects to go further to Europe. Expects to destroy freedom further in Europe. This is a fundamental challenge for the European security system.\n\nPlease take a look at what the Russian military has already done in our country. 8 years of war in the east. Occupation of Crimea. This is repression. Torture of people, suppression of all manifestations of freedom and diversity.\n\nA month of full-scale war. Total cruelty. The bombing of peaceful cities is as terrible as it was in Syria. Abduction of children. Forced transportation of children and adults to Russia. Rape in the occupied areas. Large-scale looting by the Russian military. Now tens of thousands of houses and tens of thousands of apartments have been destroyed. And there are already almost ten million migrants, three and a half million of them in the European Union.\n\nI deliberately do not want to call these Ukrainians refugees. Because I know that they will return to Ukraine. As soon as Russia leaves our land, as soon as peace is established.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**Swedish people!**\n\nSweden was one of the first to come to our aid. I am grateful to you! Your support is absolutely sincere. It is based on values. On our love for freedom. On what our blue-yellow national colors symbolize.\n\nThe whole world knows what Sweden wants. The whole world has seen in a month of this shameful war what Ukraine wants. We are together in our anti-war coalition. And we must do everything to make Russia seek peace.\n\nSweden has made a historic decision to provide Ukraine with the necessary weapons. We thank you for that! For your prudence. For your foresight.\n\nSweden supports the sanctions policy. A policy without which there will be no peace. Because the Russian leadership will not understand any language other than effective sanctions.\n\nBut for peace to come faster, sanctions packages against Russia must be applied on a weekly basis. Not a single barrel of Russian oil! No Russian ships at your ports! Not a single euro of taxes of your companies in Russia! Their military machine must be left without means of subsistence.\n\nDeliberate actions of Russian troops to destroy civilians in Ukraine, to destroy our peaceful cities must receive an inevitable and principled response from all European countries. From the free world.\n\nThis has already become the typical feature of Russian troops... Syria, Ukraine... Massacres. Cities destroyed to the ground. Phosphorus and other prohibited munitions. To prevent this from becoming a victorious strategy, all war crimes must be punished. Those who gave the order to kill and those who killed must face the Tribunal. So that no other country in the world thinks that it can kill people with impunity just like that, that it can destroy neighboring countries.\n\nI am confident that together we will be able to ensure peace, and that is why we must now think about rebuilding Ukraine after this war. And it will happen!\n\nI invite Swedish architects, Swedish companies, the Swedish state, your people to take part in this historic project.\n\nUkraine was beautiful. But now it will be great, because this is our nation. Great Ukraine. Great recovery project. For the sake of the people. For the development of our country and the whole of Europe.\n\nI invite you to show to the world, to all present and future generations that war does not bring the result. And peace does. And it gives life.\n\nSweden is the first country we offer this project to. You can take patronage over any city, region or industry to restore them. I am confident that your leadership will be indispensable. Your technology, business and your love of life. Your ability to organize space in people's best interest.\n\nUkraine - all our heroic defenders, all our citizens - has already done a lot to protect our common European values, our common European home.\n\nWe are fighting not only for Ukraine, but also for the security of the European Union! And we have proved that we deserve to be a full member of the European Union. The decision is already being elaborated. It's time to adopt it!\n\nI believe that you will support us in this as well.\n\n**Thank you, thank you Sweden!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Ми однаково – за свободу.

Not in the most powerful defense union in the world. Not one of the 30 states under the umbrella of joint protection. Under the umbrella of Article 5. It feels like we are in the \"gray zone\". Between the West and Russia. But we defend all our common values. And we are bright people! And we have been defending all these values for a month now!\n\nA month of heroic resistance. A month of the darkest suffering.\n\nA month of unpunished destruction of the peaceful state, and with it - the whole architecture of global security. All this is before the eyes of the whole world.\n\nOver the decades, Russia has accumulated considerable resources, military resources, manpower and equipment, air bombs, missiles.\n\nThey invested crazy money in death while the world invested in life. But Ukraine is holding on bravely! At the cost of thousands of lives. At the cost of destroyed cities. At the cost of almost ten million migrants. Three and a half of them are already in your territories, in the territories of NATO countries. I am grateful for the support of these people. And people, unfortunately, continue to leave their homes. They are fleeing the terror that the occupiers brought with them.\n\nThe very first hours of the invasion meant brutal missile strikes for us. During the month of the war, Russia fired more than a thousand different missiles at our cities. Made hundreds of air raids.\n\nOn February 24, I addressed you with a perfectly clear, logical request to help close our skies. In any format. Protect our people from Russian bombs and missiles. We did not hear a clear answer. Ukraine does not have powerful anti-missile weapons, and has a much smaller aircraft fleet than Russia. Therefore, their advantage in the sky is like the use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nAnd you see the consequences today - how many people were killed, how many peaceful cities were destroyed.\n\nThe Ukrainian army has been resisting for a month in unequal conditions! And I have been repeating the same thing for a month now. To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance - without restrictions. As Russia uses without restrictions its entire arsenal against us. Destroys all living things. Any objects - from houses to churches, from food warehouses to universities, from bridges to hospitals.\n\nUkraine asked for your planes. So that we do not lose so many people. And you have thousands of fighter jets! But we haven't been given any yet.\n\nWe asked for tanks. So that we can unblock our cities that are now dying - Mariupol, Berdyansk, Melitopol, others. Cities where Russia is keeping hundreds of thousands of people hostage and artificially creating famine - no water, no food, nothing there.\n\nYou have at least 20,000 tanks! Ukraine asked for a percent, one percent of all your tanks to be given or sold to us! But we do not have a clear answer yet... The worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help.\n\nUkraine never wanted this war. And does not want to fight for years. We just want to save our people. We want to survive! Just survive! Like any nation, we have the right to it. The right to life. The right to this one percent.\n\nAnd I do not blame NATO - I want to be clear. You are not guilty. It's not your missiles, it's not your bombs that are destroying our cities. This morning, by the way, there were phosphorus bombs. Phosphorus Russian bombs. Adults were killed again and children were killed again. I just want you to know that the Alliance can still prevent the deaths of Ukrainians from Russian strikes, from Russian occupation, by providing us with all the weapons we need.\n\nYes, we are not in the Alliance. And I do not make these claims. But Ukrainians never thought that the Alliance and the Allies were different.\n\nThat in matters of life and death you can be a force separately, but together - no. That NATO may be afraid of Russia's actions. I am sure you already understand that Russia does not intend to stop in Ukraine. Does not intend and will not. It wants to go further.\n\nAgainst the eastern members of NATO. The Baltic states, Poland - that's for sure. Will NATO then stop thinking about it, worrying about how Russia will react? Who can be sure of that? And do you have confidence that Article 5 can work?\n\n\"Budapest\" hasn’t worked for us already. Our Budapest Memorandum. Has not worked for peace in Ukraine.\n\nAnd I will tell you honestly - today Budapest is not working for peace in Ukraine as well. Yes, we receive help from individual members of the Alliance. I am very grateful. Ukrainians are sincerely grateful for this. To each of you who gives what you have, supporting us.\n\nBut what about the Alliance? The question of Article 5 is fundamental. I just want you to know what we think about it. And I sincerely wish you that we are wrong in our assessments and in our doubts. I sincerely wish that you actually have a very strong Alliance. Because if we are wrong, the world is safe. But if we are at least one percent right, I ask you to reconsider your attitude. Your own estimates. And really take care of security, security in Europe and, consequently, in the world.\n\nYou can give us one percent of all your aircraft. One percent of all your tanks. One percent! We can't just buy it. Such a supply directly depends only on NATO's decisions, on political decisions, by the way.\n\nMLRS systems. Anti-ship weapons. Means of air defense. Is it possible to survive such a war without it?\n\nSo when it's finally available, it will give us and you as well, one hundred percent security. And we need one. And the only thing I demand from you… After such a month of war. This is a request for the sake of our military. After such a war against Russia ... Never, please, never tell us again that our army does not meet NATO standards.\n\nWe have shown what our standards are capable of. And how much we can give to the common security in Europe and the world. How much we can do to protect against aggression against everything we value, everything you value. But NATO has yet to show what the Alliance can do to save people. To show that this is truly the most powerful defense union in the world. And the world is waiting. And Ukraine is very much waiting. Waiting for real actions. Real security guarantees. From those whose word is trustworthy. And whose actions can keep the peace.\n\nTruly. All offers are on the table. Our needs are on the table. We need peace immediately. The answers are up to you.\n\nI am thankful to those who help us! Thank you!\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"We defend all our common values.

Heroic resistance of the Ukrainian state, the Ukrainian people to the ruthless invasion of Russia. It's already a month of our defense against the attempt to destroy us. Wipe off the face of the earth.\n\nThe original plan of the Russian troops failed already in the first days of the invasion. They thought Ukrainians would be frightened. They thought Ukrainians would not fight. They were wrong.\n\nThey know nothing about us, about Ukrainians. They know nothing at all about freedom. About how valuable it is. They do not know how freedom enriches life. Gives meaning to life.\n\nBut there are many of them! There are still many invaders. Russia is getting manpower from everywhere. Equipment. Air bombs, missiles. Looking for mercenaries around the world. Any scum capable of shooting at civilians.\n\nRussian troops destroy our cities. Kill civilians indiscriminately. Rape women. Abduct children. Shoot at refugees. Capture humanitarian convoys. They are engaged in looting.\n\nThey burn museums, blow up schools and hospitals. The target for them is universities, residential neighborhoods... Anything! Russian troops do not know the limits of evil.\n\nBut...\n\nThe war of Russia is not only the war against Ukraine. Its meaning is much wider. \n\nRussia started the war against freedom as it is. \n\nThis is only the beginning for Russia on the Ukrainian land. Russia is trying to defeat the freedom of all people in Europe. Of all the people in the world. It tries to show that only crude and cruel force matters. \n\nIt tries to show that people do not matter, as well as everything else that makes us people. \n\nThat’s the reason we all must stop Russia. The world must stop the war. \n\nI thank everyone who acts in support of Ukraine. In support of freedom. But the war continues. The acts of terror against peaceful people go on. One month already! That long! It breaks my heart, hearts of all Ukrainians and every free person on the planet. \n\nThat’s why I ask you to stand against the war! Starting from March 24 – exactly one month after the Russian invasion… From this day and after then. \n\nShow your standing! Come from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities. Come in the name of peace. Come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life. \n\nCome to your squares, your streets. Make yourselves visible and heard. Say that people matter. Freedom matters. Peace matters. Ukraine matters. \n\nFrom March 24. \n\nIn downtowns of your cities.\n\nAll as one together who want to stop the war.\n\nI want to address the citizens of Russia separately.\n\nI am sure that there are many of you who are disgusted by the policy of your state. Who are already just sick of what you see on TV. Of the lies of your propagandists on the Internet. Propagandists who are paid by your taxes. And they lie about the war, which is paid for by your taxes. And which makes all the citizens of Russia poorer. Poorer every day.\n\nIsn't that stupid? Your state collects taxes from you to make you poorer. To isolate you from the world. To make it easier for them to control you. And easier to send you to the war to die.\n\nUkraine has never threatened the security of Russia.\n\nEven now, we are doing everything just to bring peace back to our land. Not to yours - to our land. To our people.\n\nWe are doing everything to end this war. And when we succeed - it will certainly happen - you will be sure of at least one thing: your children will no longer be sent to die on our land, on our territory.\n\nTherefore, you, the citizens of Russia, are also interested in peace. Save your sons from the war. Tell the truth about the war. And if you can leave Russia so as not to give your taxes to the war, do it.\n\nAll polls show that the people of Europe and America support us.\n\nI am grateful to all of you for that. Grateful on behalf of Ukraine. To everyone in the European Union, the United States, Canada, Britain and other countries for supporting us. For supporting freedom. For supporting Ukraine.\n\nOn March 24, three important summits will take place in Brussels, Europe. Important for the security of each of us. NATO Summit. EU Summit. G7 Summit.\n\nI'm sure people will show how they support us. But politicians must also support freedom. All of them. They must support the struggle for life.\n\nWe are waiting for meaningful steps. From NATO, the EU and the G7.\n\nWe know that the Russians have already begun to lobby their interests. These are the interests of war. We know that they are working with some partners. We know that they want to put this issue out. The struggle against war. But this is the war that needs to be put out. \n\nOur firm position will be represented at these three summits. At these three summits we will see: Who is a friend, who is a partner, and who betrayed us for money.\n\nLife can be defended only when united. Freedom must be armed.\n\nUkrainian sky has not been made safe from Russian missiles and bombs. We have not received aircraft and modern anti-missile weapons. We have not received tanks, anti-ship equipment. Russian forces can keep killing thousands of our citizens, destroying our cities. Just because there are too many invaders. Just because Russia has been preparing for such a war for decades.\n\nWe asked to close our sky. And we asked for assistance from NATO to be effective and without limits. Any support in weapons that we need. We asked the Alliance to say it will fully help Ukraine win this war, clear our territories of the invaders and restore peace in Ukraine. \n\n**Free people of the free world! **\n\nTogether we must prevent Russia from breaking someone in NATO, EU or G7. From breaking and taking it to the war side. We will see on March 24.\n\n**Ukrainians! All our heroes!**\n\nA month has passed. We withstood six times longer than the enemy had planned, than the Russian command had reported to the Russian president.\n\nThey were convinced that Ukraine is not a state. They were convinced that Ukrainians are not a nation. They deceived themselves. But we don't care about them. This is their state suicide. And we are just protecting our lives. Our freedom. Our own state. Our children. Hence, our future.\n\nThis is a war for independence. And we must win.\n\nWe will rebuild every city that heroically resists. We will bring the invaders to justice for every crime. Zhytomyr and Sumy, Kyiv and Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, Volnovakha and Mykolaiv, Okhtyrka and Hostomel, Kherson and Odesa, Izyum and Donetsk, Luhansk and Chornobaivka... All our people will live! In a free Ukraine. After our victory. Which will come sooner, the more we will all be united.\n\nWe are all Ukrainians. We are all Europeans. We are all free people of the free world.\n\nIn unity! On the battlefield and in political positions, at rallies and summits, at work and in communication with people. By all our actions, we must force Russia to seek peace. By all our actions, we must bring the victory of freedom closer.\n\nMay the memory of all who died for Ukraine live forever!\n\n**Eternal glory to all our heroes!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"On March 24 it will be the month of our resistance.

You know why this is happening. And you know who is to blame. Even those who hide their heads in the sand know. And whose hands are still trying to get money from Russia.\n\nSo today I am addressing you. Honest, brave, rational and freedom-loving. I am addressing you with questions: how to stop the war? How to return peace to our state? Because most of the puzzles that make up the answer are in your hands.\n\nOn March 9, Russian bombs were dropped on a children's hospital and a maternity hospital in our city of Mariupol. It was a peaceful city in the south of Ukraine. Absolutely peaceful - until Russian troops approached and besieged it, as in the Middle Ages. Until they began to torture people with famine, thirst, kill with fire.\n\nThere were people in the maternity hospital on which the Russians dropped bombs. There were women in labor. Most of them were saved. Some were seriously injured. One woman had to have her foot amputated, as it was completely shattered.\n\nAnd another woman... She had a shattered pelvis. Her child died before birth. Doctors tried to save the woman. Fought for her life! But she begged the doctors for her death. She begged to leave her, not to help her. Because she didn't know what to live for. They fought. She died. In Ukraine. In Europe. In 2022. When hundreds of millions of people could not even think that it could be so, that the world could be so ruined.\n\nI ask you now to honor the memory of thousands of Ukrainian men and women, all those who were killed as a result of Russia's invasion of the territory of our peaceful Ukraine with a moment of silence.\n\nAfter weeks of Russian invasion, Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities hit by the occupiers resemble the ruins of Verdun. As in the photos of the First World War, which, I'm sure, each and every one of you saw. The Russian militaries do not care which targets to hit. They destroy everything: residential neighborhoods, hospitals, schools, universities. Warehouses with food and medicine are being burned. They burn everything.\n\nThey do not take into account concepts such as \"war crime\" and \"binding conventions\". They brought terror to Ukraine, state terror. Each and every one of you is aware of this. All information is available. All the facts are there.\n\nAbout women raped by the Russian military in the temporarily occupied areas. About refugees shot on the roads. About journalists they kill knowing for sure that they are journalists. About old people who survived the Holocaust and are now forced to save themselves from Russian attacks on peaceful cities in bomb shelters.\n\nFor 80 years, Europe has not seen the things that are happening in Ukraine now. Because of Russia's actions. When there are people so desperate that they beg for death! Like this woman.\n\nIn 2019, when I became President, there was already a format for negotiations with Russia. It was the Normandy format. The format of negotiations that were to end the war in Donbas. The war in eastern Ukraine, which has been going on for 8 years, unfortunately.\n\nFour countries took part in the Normandy format - Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France. Four, but through them the whole world, all positions were represented. Someone supported. Someone was trying to delay the process. Someone wanted to ruin everything. But it seemed important that the world was always present at that Normandy table, the table of peace.\n\nAnd when the negotiations yielded the result, when we managed to free people from captivity, when we were able to agree on some decisions in December 2019, it was like a breath of fresh air. Like a glimmer of hope. Hope that talks with Russia can help. That the Russian leadership can be convinced in words so that Moscow chooses peace.\n\nBut February 24 came. A day that ruined all those efforts. All of us. Ruined the old meaning of the word \"dialogue\". Ruined the European experience of relations with Russia. Ruined decades of European history.\n\nAll this was bombed by Russian troops. Destroyed by Russian artillery. Burned after Russian missile strikes.\n\nThe truth was not found in the offices. So now we have to look for it and gain it on the battlefield.\n\nSo what now? What do we have left? Our values. Unity. And the determination to defend our freedom. Common freedom! One for Paris and Kyiv. For Berlin and Warsaw. For Madrid and Rome. For Brussels and Bratislava.\n\nSips of fresh air will definitely not help anymore. It makes sense to act together. To put pressure together. To force Russia to seek peace.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**French people!**\n\nOn February 24, the Ukrainian people united. Today we have no right or left. We do not look at who is in power and who is in opposition. The usual policy ended on the day of Russia's invasion and will resume only when there is peace.\n\nAnd this is right - to fight for life. To protect our state.\n\nWe are grateful to you, we are grateful that France helps. We are grateful for the efforts of President Macron. Who showed true leadership. We are constantly communicating with him, it is true, we are coordinating some of our steps.\n\nUkrainians see that France values freedom as much as it has always been. And you protect it. You remember what it is. Freedom, equality, brotherhood. Each of these words is full of power for you! I feel it. Ukrainians feel it.\n\nThat is why we expect from you, we expect from France, from your leadership, that you will be able to make Russia seek peace. To make it end this war against freedom. Against equality. Against brotherhood. Against everything that made Europe united and full of free diverse life.\n\nWe expect from France, from your leadership, that Ukraine's territorial integrity will be restored. And together we can do it.\n\nIf among the attendees there are those who doubt it, your people are already sure. Like other nations of Europe.\n\nAnd that during France's presidency in the European Union the long overdue historical decision will be made - on Ukraine's full membership in Europe and the EU. Historical decision in historical time. As has always been the case in the history of the French people.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**French people!**\n\nTomorrow will be a month since Ukrainians have been fighting for their own lives, for their own freedom, since our army has been heroically opposing the overwhelming forces of Russia.\n\nWe need more help! We need more support!\n\nIn order for freedom not to lose, it must be well-armed. Tanks and anti-tank weapons, aviation and air defense. We need all this! You can help us. I know. You can!\n\nIn order for freedom not to lose, the world must support it with sanctions against the aggressor. A new sanctions package every week. Every week!\n\nFrench companies must leave the Russian market. Renault, Auchan, Leroy Merlin and others. They must cease to be sponsors of Russia's military machine, sponsors of the killing of children and women, sponsors of rape, robbery and looting by the Russian army.\n\nAll companies must remember once and for all that values are worth more than profit. Especially profit on blood. And we must already think about the future. About how we will live after this war.\n\nGuarantees are needed. Strong guarantees. Guarantees that security will be unshakable, that there will be no war, and that war in general will be impossible.\n\nWe are creating such a system of guarantees. A new security system. In which France, I believe, will play a leading role. So that no one will ever have to beg for death again! So that people live their life. Full life. And so that we say goodbye to people not under bombs, not in war, but when the time comes.\n\nOnly in peace. Only in dignity. Because you have to live so that you are respected. So that you are remembered. And so that people say goodbye to you in a way France said goodbye to the great Belmondo.\n\n**Thank you, France!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Today I am addressing you.

On average, it's 15 hours on a plane. Depending on the route. But what is the distance between our feelings of freedom? Between our desires to live? Between our aspirations for peace?\n\nOn February 24, I did not see any distance. Even a millimeter between our capitals. Even a second between our feelings. Because you immediately came to our aid. And I'm grateful to you for that.\n\nWhen Russia destroyed peace for the entire Ukraine, we immediately saw that the world is truly against the war. Truly for freedom. Truly for global security. Truly for the harmonious development of every society. Japan has become the leader of this position in Asia. You immediately started working to stop this brutal war started by the Russian Federation. You immediately started working for peace in Ukraine. Hence, in Europe. And this is really very important. It is important for everyone on Earth. Because without peace for Ukraine, no person in the world will be able to look to the future with confidence.\n\nEach of you knows what Chornobyl is. Nuclear power plant in Ukraine, where a powerful explosion occurred in 1986. Radiation release. The consequences of which have been recorded in different parts of the planet. The 30-kilometer zone around the Chornobyl station is still closed. It is hazardous. During the elimination of the consequences of the explosion at the station, thousands of tons of contaminated materials, debris and cars were disposed of in the forests in the closed area. Just in the ground.\n\nOn February 24, Russian armored vehicles passed through this land. Lifting radioactive dust into the air. The Chornobyl station was captured. By force, by weapon. Imagine a nuclear power plant where a disaster happened. Confinement that closes the destroyed reactor. Operating nuclear waste storage facility. Russia has turned this facility into an arena of war as well. And Russia is using this 30-kilometer territory, this closed zone, to prepare new attacks against our defense forces.\n\nIt will take years after Russian troops leave Ukraine to investigate the damage they have done to Chornobyl. What sites of radioactive materials disposal were damaged. And how radioactive dust spread on the planet.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\nThere are four operating nuclear power plants on our land! These are 15 nuclear units. And they are all under threat. Russian troops have already fired from tanks at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. The fighting has damaged hundreds of plants, many of them particularly dangerous. The shelling threatens gas and oil pipelines. Coal mines.\n\nThe other day, Russian troops also fired at a chemical plant in the Sumy region of Ukraine. There was a leak of ammonia. We are warned about possible chemical attacks, in particular with the use of sarin. As it was in Syria.\n\nAnd one of the main topics for discussion of world politicians is the question: how to react if Russia also uses nuclear weapons. Any confidence of any person in the world, any country is completely destroyed.\n\nOur servicemen have been heroically defending Ukraine for 28 days already. 28 days of full-scale invasion of the largest state in the world. But not the greatest in potential. Not the most influential. And the smallest from a moral point of view.\n\nRussia has used more than a thousand missiles against peaceful cities in Ukraine. Countless bombs. Russian troops destroyed dozens of our cities. Some were burned to the ground. In many towns and villages that have come under Russian occupation, our people cannot even bury their murdered relatives, friends and neighbors with dignity. They have to bury them right in the yards of broken houses, near roads, anywhere where it is possible...\n\nThousands were killed, including 121 children.\n\nAbout 9 million Ukrainians were forced to leave their home, their native places, fleeing from Russian troops. Our northern territories, eastern, southern are becoming empty, because people are fleeing from this deadly threat.\n\nRussia has even blocked the sea for us. Usual trade routes. Showing some other - potential - aggressors of the world how to put pressure on free nations by blocking sea navigation.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\nToday, it is Ukraine, the partner states and our anti-war coalition that can guarantee that world security will not be completely destroyed. That in the world there will be a foothold for the freedom of nations. For people and for the preservation of diversity in societies. For security of borders. To make sure that we, our children, our grandchildren still have peace.\n\nYou see that international institutions have not worked. Even the UN and the Security Council... What can they do? They need reform. They need an injection of honesty. To become effective. To really decide and really influence, not just discuss.\n\nDue to Russia's war against Ukraine, the world is destabilized. The world is on the verge of many new crises. And who is now sure what tomorrow will be like?\n\nTurbulence in world markets is a problem for all countries that depend on imports of raw materials. Environmental and food challenges are unprecedented. And most importantly, it is now being decided whether all the aggressors on the planet - explicit and potential - will be convinced that the war they have waged will lead to a punishment so powerful that they should not start a war. That they should not destroy the world. And it is absolutely logical and correct that the responsible states unite to protect peace.\n\nI am grateful to your state for its principled position at such a historic moment. For real help to Ukraine. You were the first in Asia to put real pressure on Russia to restore peace. Who supported the sanctions against Russia. And I urge you to continue to do so.\n\nI call for the united efforts of the Asian countries, your partners, to stabilize the situation. So that Russia seeks peace. And stops the tsunami of its brutal invasion of our state, Ukraine. It is necessary to impose an embargo on trade with Russia. It is necessary to withdraw companies from the Russian market so that the money does not go to the Russian army. It is necessary to help our state, our defenders, our soldiers who are holding back Russian troops even more. It is necessary to start thinking about rebuilding Ukraine already now. About the return of life to the cities destroyed by Russia and the territories devastated by it.\n\nPeople need to go back to where they lived. Where they grew up. Where they feel is their home. Their small homeland. I'm sure you understand this feeling. This need. The need to return to your land.\n\nWe need to develop new security guarantees. So that it is possible to act preventively and strongly every time there is a threat to peace.\n\nIs it possible to do this on the basis of existing international structures? After such a war - definitely not. We need to create new tools. New guarantees. Which will work preventively and strongly against any aggression. Which will really help. Japan's leadership can be indispensable in their development. For Ukraine, for the world. I offer it to you.\n\nSo that the world can feel confident again. Confident about what tomorrow will be like. Confident that tomorrow will come and will be stable and peaceful. For us, for future generations.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**Japanese people!**\n\nWe can do a lot together with you. Even more than we can imagine.\n\nI know what a brilliant history of development you have. How you can build and defend harmony. Follow the principles and value life. Protect the environment. The roots of this are in your culture. Which Ukrainians really love. My words are not unsubstantiated. This is actually true.\n\nBack in 2019, literally six months after I became President of Ukraine, my wife Olena took part in a project for children with visual impairments. In the project to create audiobooks. And she voiced Japanese fairy tales. In Ukrainian. Because they are understandable for us, for children. And it was only a drop in the huge sea of our attention, the Ukrainian attention, to your attainment.\n\nWe have similar values with you despite the huge distance between our countries. A distance that doesn't really exist. Because we have equally warm hearts. Thanks to joint efforts, thanks to even greater pressure on Russia, we will come to peace. And we will be able to rebuild our country. Reform international institutions. \n\nI am sure that Japan will be with us then - just as it is now. In our anti-war coalition. At this crucial time for all of us.\n\n**Thank you!**\n\n**Arigato gozaimasu!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n\n**Glory to Japan!**\n    ",description:"There are four operating nuclear power plants on our land!

I thanked His Holiness for a clear and strong position against the war and for his prayers for Ukraine. I invited him to visit our country at this crucial time. I believe that we will be able to organize this important visit, which will unequivocally support each of us, each of the Ukrainians.\n\nI addressed both chambers of the Italian parliament today. I felt maximum support. Sincere warmth in words. I called on Italy to strengthen sanctions against Russia and its regime. And strike hard at all Russian figures responsible for this war. For the war against us. Strike at their real estate, accounts and yachts. Strike at their habit to earn money by war and to live and have a rest far away, in Europe, where it is peaceful and cozy.\n\nI am sure that new sanctions will be introduced this week. And I am grateful to Italy for supporting Ukraine's membership in the EU.\n\nI spoke with President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová. About our cooperation and our security. About the development of Ukraine - with all together, in the European Union.\n\nAn important conversation also took place with the Prime Minister of Canada. We continue to coordinate our positions on the eve of this week's NATO and G7 summits. Justin Trudeau will support us.\n\nA special aspect is security guarantees for Ukraine. They are vital not only for us, but also for all neighboring countries. Because of our security, which will cement peace in Eastern Europe.\n\nI am grateful to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece who was the first European official to decide to support the work of our humanitarian corridors in Mariupol. To evacuate our people from the city and bring in humanitarian aid, which is crucially important for everyone.\n\nAs of today, there are about a hundred thousand people in the city. In inhumane conditions. In a complete blockade. No food, no water, no medicine. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing.\n\nFor more than a week now we have been trying to organize stable humanitarian corridors for Mariupol residents. And almost all our attempts, unfortunately, are disrupted by the Russian occupiers. By shelling or deliberate terror.\n\nToday, one of the humanitarian columns was simply captured by the occupiers. On the agreed route near Manhush. SES employees and bus drivers were taken prisoner.\n\nWe are doing everything we can to free our people and unblock the movement of humanitarian aid. That is why I am grateful when a high-level representative of a European state agrees to personally join the humanitarian mission.\n\nWe expect the implementation of this plan by the Greek Foreign Minister in the coming days.\n\nDespite all the difficulties, 7,026 Mariupol residents were rescued today.\n\nTomorrow we will continue this important work.\n\nOur representatives are trying to agree on humanitarian corridors in the Kyiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk regions.\n\nAnother important news is that an online tool has been created for everyone who can and wants to help with humanitarian goods for Ukraine.\n\nIn the last two weeks alone, our country has received more than 100,000 tons of humanitarian aid.\n\nThese cargoes are quickly distributed through special hubs for the regions. But there are even more appeals. Even more opportunities. Even more work.\n\nTherefore, to simplify the process as much as possible, the website help.gov.ua was created.\n\nOn the website you can learn how to buy, how to send and whom to address humanitarian aid. This is for everyone who wants to join. For anyone who can help. In Ukraine and in the world. So that the aid is sent constantly, 24/7.\n\nOur Armed Forces pleased us today. Chornobaivka again - the defeat of the occupiers again. Russian planes were shot down again. Especially important - the bomber was shot down over Mariupol. And so it will be with everyone who kills our people, peaceful people on our peaceful land.\n\nI want to repeat once again to all Russian pilots who do not think about the order they fulfill. Killing civilians is a crime. And you will be responsible anyway. Today or tomorrow - this is less important. The main thing is that it is inevitable.\n\nWe continue to work at various levels to force Russia to peace. To the end of this brutal war. Ukrainian representatives are working on the negotiations, which continue virtually every day. It's very difficult. Sometimes scandalous. But step by step we are moving forward.\n\nI am also grateful to all the international mediators who are fighting for Ukraine, for Europe, for the truth. Who bring to Moscow the real picture. Honest. And encourage to look realistically. At what happens in battles. And at the fact that the world will not stop defending the truth. Our truth.\n\nThree important summits this week: the G7, NATO and the EU. New sanctions packages, new aid. We will work, we will fight in any way we can. Till the end. Bravely and openly. At all these sites. With full energy.\n\nFor the result. With all our strength. And we will not get tired. Let's rest when we win. And it definitely will happen.\n\n**Glory to all our heroes!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Сьогодні був один із тих днів, які дають змогу впевнено говорити, що з нами – увесь світ.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K1NlX4TFb0"},{id:"mIfAeDGjSq8",name:"Speech by Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak at Chatham House",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Андрій Єрмак"],date:"2022-03-22T22:42:40",topics:["Гуманітарна катастрофа","Закрите небо","Вступ до ЄС"],cities:[],text:'\nThe hardest part of any speech is the beginning. You all probably know that. In other circumstances, I would have spent a lot of time on it. On the right, most appropriate beginning. But I don\'t have time. So I\'ll start with the simple.\n\nWe have been told for years that Ukraine is not reforming properly. But let\'s look at the results. The modernized Armed Forces have been holding back the aggression of one of the world\'s most powerful armies for almost a month already. Logistics chains are functioning. The courts are working. Trains run and transport millions of people. Utilities are doing their job even under shelling and bombing.\n\nThe test of war is perhaps the most severe. We are successfully reforming even now. And our sustainability turned out to be absolutely real.\n\nBut sustainability is not an absolute category. It\'s not about availability, it\'s about measure. How much is left? Depends on many factors:\n\n* **On our determination** - here there are no changes. We are on our land. We defend our values. Our way of life. Our freedom. You can be sure of us.\n* **On external support** - everything is ambiguous here.\n\nWe now enjoy serious support. The West has finally become collective. This is evidenced by sanctions against Russia and support for Ukraine - humanitarian, economic, political, military and technical. But is that enough? And for how long will the West keep it? For how long are those states that have sought to maintain economic ties with Russia at all costs, even in the face of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine willing to suffer losses from disruption of these ties?\n\nGiven the experience of the previous eight years, we cannot be too optimistic here. However, now the risks for the whole world have grown so much that they will simply not be allowed to do business as usual.\n\nThe next factor is the factor of Russia itself. What is its margin of safety? What are its goals?\n\nThe West is constantly talking about increasing the price that Russia will have to pay for aggression. But can we imagine the limit beyond which the Russian leadership will say: it is too expensive? It should be understood that the narrative of "victory at any cost" is not just a propaganda cliche. Moscow has repeatedly instrumentalized it, beating the stake of those it considered enemies. In the number of victims. In the violation of international law. In resorting to blackmail, including threats of man-made disasters and unconventional weapons. In everything. This must be understood.\n\nAt the same time, it should be understood that "small victorious wars" that do not achieve their goal always increase Russia\'s risk of a social explosion and coup. Success in war, on the other hand, stabilizes and preserves the regime. Nourishes its desire for further conquests.\n\nYou may ask, what is the conclusion?\n\nAnd the conclusion is that Ukraine must win the war that Russia has started against us.\n\nWe must work only for such a result. All of us.\n\nWhat is happening in Ukraine now concerns everyone. Everyone in this room. Every government. Everyone in the world. The war in Ukraine is not just another local conflict. This is a world war that is so far going on in our country.\n\nI would like to emphasize once again that Russia\'s encroachments go far beyond Ukraine. It claims to restore the Soviet sphere of influence in both Europe and Asia. It claims to break the entire system of international relations and discredit all security institutions.\n\nTherefore, Kazakhstan, Poland, the Baltic States, Slovakia, Moldova, and Georgia may be next… Yes, Moldova and Georgia again. Georgia, which after Saakashvili is again afraid to say the wrong word to Moscow. Well, apparently, this is such a non-trivial course of Tbilisi\'s European integration.\n\nOn the Russian military equipment they write "To Berlin!" once again. Do you know what that means? We know. The Israelis know. Believe those who promise to kill you.\n\nIn the case of Ukraine, the goal of Russia is one - to destroy. To deprive of agency. To stop nation building. According to the program thesis about one nation, which we have been hearing for two decades. Therefore, one may say that this war has no rational basis. It is a war of will, not of necessity. But this is probably the first historiosophical war in history.\n\nTherefore, we must assume that the current leadership of Russia will not abandon this goal. And it is ready to pay. The question of whether its entourage is willing to pay can now be omitted.\n\nSo let\'s focus on this - the intention to destroy Ukraine.\n\nThis was not achieved by rapid operation. None of the strategic tasks of the invading force were fulfilled.\n\nTherefore, the aggressor is trying to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe, destroy critical civilian infrastructure and industrial potential.\n\nWe must take into account that the war is taking place on our territory. That our people are dying, that our cities are being destroyed. Our Armed Forces and citizens are holding on with superhuman courage, but we cannot win the war without offensive weapons, without medium-range missiles that can be a means of deterrence (I emphasize: in our case - deterrence, not aggression) threatening Russian territory with comparative destruction.\n\nWithout a full Lend-Lease, we can only defend ourselves. But it is impossible to defend effectively for a long time without a reliable echelon of air defense systems that shoot down enemy ballistic missiles at a long distance.\n\nHowever, we are not given it. Just as we are not given fighter jets. Just as we are not welcome in NATO.\n\nThis fear of escalation is understandable. But this fear will not save you.\n\nWinston Churchill explained everything: he who chooses shame between shame and war, gets both shame and war.\n\nI once produced "Forebodings" movie directed by the talented Vyacheslav Kristofovich. So, the protagonist has such a remarkable phrase: "Everything must happen on time." Today I feel the power of this phrase more than ever. Everything must happen on time. Now it is high time.\n\nAn extraordinary meeting of the Allies is scheduled to take place in Brussels this Thursday, March 24. There is still time to take concrete steps towards Ukraine. Or to say honestly and publicly that there will be no such steps. That NATO is refusing to allow Ukraine to join, not Ukraine is refusing to join, as many have been trying to pretend lately. To say - and together start building a new security system.\n\nThe Russian leadership understands only the language of power and always confuses peacefulness with weakness. I want to ask our European partners: what are you really like? Are you peaceful or weak?\n\nWill you finally give us the weapons that will allow Ukraine to remain an independent sovereign state within internationally recognized borders? Will you finally launch a full-fledged Lend-Lease for us? Or will you continue to watch with concern as our cities turn into ruins?\n\nI\'ll just say simply: close our skies or at least give us long-range air defense systems. Your fear of escalation nurtures aggression. Your determination holds it back.\n\nClearly articulated position "We will shoot down planes that are instruments of terror. We will destroy the Russian air defense systems that will attack our air police,” is what we need.\n\nTomorrow. Now. Yesterday. Otherwise, Ukraine will bleed out. Become depopulated. We will not surrender, it is already clear to everyone. But let me remind you what I said at the beginning: sustainability is not about availability, but about measure.\n\nAfter the Russian occupation of Crimea and the invasion of Donbas, foreign experts began to talk about the "Finlandization" of Ukraine. They meant only one thing: neutral status and "special" relations with Russia. But for some reason none of them said that "Finlandization" is the preservation of the state, its agency and the freedom of the people at the cost of the forced loss of certain territories as a result of aggression.\n\nBut we will not give up our sovereignty or territorial integrity. And when we return our territories at the cost of incredible efforts and sacrifices, it will be our victory, but not Russia\'s defeat.\n\nBecause without decisive actions of the world community, nothing will prevent the aggressor from continuing to strike at any place of our state.\n\nAnd every such blow to Ukraine will be a blow to international law. The intensification of the refugee crisis in the EU. The collapse of the world security system and the institutions that guarantee it. After all, it is a blow to global food security.\n\nIn fact, all this is a key sign of a world order crisis. An order where the readiness of the international community to punish acts of aggression, punish genocide remains largely declarative. Profit over justice - was that why the UN was created? Has Europe united around this?\n\nIf so, none of the existing security systems is suitable for Ukraine. We need a new one. Fair. This system will have to be built from scratch. We are ready. And we paid for it. Paid the highest price - pain, sweat, blood, lives. This fee gives us the moral right to demand: act! Right now!\n\nTo put it simply, the "Finlandization" of Ukraine or any other model of neutralization on Russian terms, which does not involve building a new security system, will only guarantee that these challenges and threats will last forever.\n\nSo I will ask: European countries, where will your refugees flee to?\n\nUkraine remains Europe\'s only shield. But what happens if this shield is critically damaged?\n\nThe half-hearted position of the world community, unfortunately, makes this scenario possible. In this case, reliable guarantees of our security become fundamentally important for us. Multilateral legally binding guarantees. But is there anything as reliable in the West as the NATO umbrella? Sorry, we are not aware of that.\n\nAnd the world needs the same credible assurances that Russia will no longer be able to successfully pursue its military ambitions in the international arena. We demand such guarantees from our partners. Citizens of other states, demand such guarantees from your government officials. Demand now, because tomorrow will be late.\n\nWithout such guarantees, any of our agreements will be fragile and temporary. And they will hold until the moment when Russia regains its strength and tries to attack again. The timing of this will depend directly on the pace of easing of sanctions pressure on Russia and its ability to circumvent restrictive measures. We therefore call for steady and unwavering strengthening of these sanctions. International businesses should not think about how to bypass them for the sake of profits. They must not become an accomplice in crimes against humanity. Such complicity should not only be a burden on the conscience. We call on foreign governments to prosecute such collaborations. Up to the criminal liability.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy said this very clearly: "Do not sponsor Russia\'s military machine. No euro for the occupiers. Close all your ports to them, do not supply goods, give up Russian energy resources, force Russia to leave Ukraine. I believe that peace is possible, but you must act to come to peace."\n\nGovernments are hesitant. But ordinary people have already made a choice. They are convinced that Ukraine has a place in the EU. This is the average opinion of 71% of respondents. 79% of Europeans believe that sanctions against Russia are the right thing to do. 67% of EU citizens believe that Ukraine needs to be provided with weapons. These are the results of a poll published by the French Institute of Public Opinion (IFOP).\n\nThese figures are more than eloquent. So I will tell governments to finally listen to your voters.\n\nWe call on the international community - not only the collective West, but also China and India - to put aside discord among themselves. The war in Ukraine affects all of you. You are the leaders of this world. Someone will talk about the two poles. I\'m talking about two parts of the whole. The Russian issue should not prevent you from reaching an agreement. The interpenetration of economies and integration is a much more powerful guarantee of global peace than the threat of mutual destruction.\n\nYou can reach an agreement. Russia\'s aggression against Ukraine may seem to some a good opportunity to fulfill their own ambitions. However, in reality this is a false impression: hopes that the war will be "localized" in Ukraine are in vain. Without proper rebuff, Moscow will not stop, and each of its subsequent ventures will inevitably bring the world closer to the hot global conflict.\n\nThe dramatic events in Ukraine, the heroic struggle of our country for freedom and democracy have shown the whole world: our east and west are together. Now we call on the world to become a little bit like Ukraine.\n\nEast and West, stand together to protect the planet from those who seek to replace the force of law with the law of force.\n    ',description:"The test of war is perhaps the most severe.

And the huge amount of blood it wants to shed.\n\nWhen I addressed a rally in Florence and dozens of other European cities a little over a week ago, I asked all Italians, all Europeans to remember the number 79.

So that it ends this brutal war. 117 children, thousands of adults. Thousands wounded. Tens of thousands of destroyed families. Hundreds of thousands of ruined destinies. Millions, already millions of abandoned homes. And it all started with one person.\n\nIn the occupied areas, murdered families are buried right in the yards of high-rise buildings. In the parks. In mass graves. This is happening today. In 2022. And we know that every next day of the war will take the lives of our children. 117 is not a final number. The Russian invasion will destroy more families and destinies. Unfortunately, the full-scale war continues. Russian missiles, aircraft and artillery do not stop killing. Ukrainian cities are being ruined. Some are almost completely destroyed.\n\nLike Mariupol. You heard of it. Our city on the shore of the Sea of Azov. Where about half a million people lived. Just as in your city of Genoa. I was there. And now there is nothing in Mariupol. Only ruins.\n\nImagine completely burned Genoa. After three weeks of total blockade. Bombing, shelling, which did not stop for a moment. Ruined Genoa, from which people are being evacuated, your wonderful people. On foot, by cars, by buses... Just to get to where it is safe.\n\nI am addressing you from Kyiv, our capital. From a city that is as important to our region as Rome is to the whole world. The origin of the great culture of a great nation is in Kyiv. And now we are on the verge of survival. Kyiv has gone through brutal wars throughout its history. And it deserves, after all the losses and tragedies, to live in peace. In eternal peace.\n\nAs Rome and any other city in our world deserves. But, unfortunately, there is an air alarm in Kyiv every day. Bombs and rockets fall every day.\n\nNear Kyiv, in neighboring towns and districts, there are several groups of Russian troops. Those who kill and torture, rape and kidnap children, destroy and rob. The occupiers take our property to Russia by trucks. The last one who did something like this in Europe were the Nazis. When they invaded other countries.\n\nRussian troops have even mined the sea near our ports. And now it threatens neighboring shores and neighboring countries, because mines can drift by sea to them.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**Italian people!**\n\nIt’s time to do everything possible to ensure peace!\n\nThis is a war that Russia has been preparing for a long time. Which one person has been preparing for a long time. One! For decades. Earning crazy money on oil and gas exports and directing them to prepare for war. And not only against Ukraine. Their goal is Europe. Decisive influence on your life, control over your policy, destruction of your values. Not only ours. Democracy, human rights, equality, freedom... The same values as ours.\n\nUkraine is the gateway to Europe for Russian troops. They want to break in. But barbarism must not pass. Ukrainians were one of the first to come to your aid when you needed it during the COVID pandemic. We sent our doctors. Italians were among the first to come to our aid when our people were affected by the terrible floods.\n\nYou supported us - sincerely, quickly. Without asking for anything in return. You are helping us now - we really appreciate it. But still...\n\nThe invasion has not stopped in 27 days. Almost a month. So more sanctions are needed, even more pressure, so that Russia is looking not for military reserves or mercenaries somewhere in Libya or Syria, but for peace. So that the same one person is looking for peace. The consequences of this war are already felt in many parts of the world. Not only in Europe. And the worst thing will be famine. Approaching different countries.\n\nUkraine has always been one of the largest exporters of food. But how can we sow under the blows of Russian artillery? How can we sow when the enemy deliberately mines the fields, destroys fuel bases? We do not know what harvest we will have and whether we’ll be able to export. When our ports are blocked and seized. Corn, vegetable oil, wheat and many other products. Vital goods. For your neighbors as well. Across the sea.\n\nPrices are already rising. So how many tens of millions of people will need help? In front of your shores...\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**Italian people!**\n\nYou know Ukrainians well. Our people who never wanted to fight. Who are Europeans just like you. You know those who brought war to Ukraine. You know for sure. Those who order to fight. And those who promote it. Almost all of them use Italy. As a place for vacation. So don\'t be a resort for murderers. Block all their real estate, accounts and yachts - from "Scheherazade" to the smallest ones. Block the assets of all those who have influence in Russia. Let them apply their influence for peace. To be able to come back to you someday. Support greater sanctions against Russia. A complete embargo on trade, starting with oil. Support a ban on entering your ports for Russian ships. So that they feel the price for their aggression and for mining the sea.\n\nThere should be no exceptions to the sanctions regime for any Russian bank. Do not allow the food crisis in your neighboring regions. Help us. Stop the killings. Save Ukrainian families.\n\nThis war must end as soon as possible. Peace must be restored. Enemy troops must be withdrawn from Ukraine. Demining must be carried out. And reconstruction. Reconstruction of Ukraine after this war. Together with you, together with Italy. Together with Europe. Together - in the European Union.\n\nBefore the war, I often visited your country. I appreciate your hospitality, sincerity and sometimes loudness. I saw what family and children mean to you. You have wonderful families, you have wonderful children. What life means to you. I want to thank you for helping the Ukrainians who found a shelter from this war in your country.\n\nToday, there are more than 70,000 of our people in Italy who, unfortunately, had to hide from the war. More than 25 thousand children. And many of them have received warmth in your Italian families. Including in the families present in this hall. The first Ukrainian was born in Italy, whose mother found refuge on your land. Dozens of Ukrainian children with severe shell shock and injuries are being treated by you.\n\nWe are grateful to you for that, very grateful! And we are waiting for them to return home. To Ukraine - already peaceful. And you can definitely help us with that.\n\nFrom the first day of this war, you have shared our pain and are helping sincerely - from the heart. Ukrainians will always remember this. Your warmth, your care and your strength that must stop one person. Just one person for millions to survive.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n\n**Grazie Italia!**\n',description:"В окупованих районах ховають убиті родини прямо у дворах багатоповерхівок. У парках.

After 8 years of aggression in the east of our state.\n\nThe enemy is slowly trying to move. To go on the offensive somewhere. To capture our road somewhere. To cross the river somewhere. The Ukrainian army - well done - repels these attempts. And holds back the occupiers.\n\nToday, Russian troops hit the Zhytomyr region with Grads. They got a decent answer.\n\nAnother enemy aircraft was shot down in the Kharkiv region near Chuhuiv. Our military has already shot down so many Russian planes and helicopters that one can only wonder: what do their pilots have instead of mind? Is it also emptiness?\n\nI said “also” not by accident, because they definitely have emptiness instead of heart. Instead of soul. Instead of everything that makes a human human.\n\nBorys Romanchenko, a former prisoner of Nazi concentration camps, was killed in Kharkiv. He was 96 years old. Think about it - he went through so much! He survived in Buchenwald, Dora-Mittelbau, Peenemünde and Bergen-Belsen - the death conveyors created by the Nazis.\n\nAnd he was killed by a Russian projectile that hit an ordinary Kharkiv high-rise building...\n\nEach passing day of this war makes it increasingly clear what their "denazification" is.\n\nIn Kherson, the occupiers shot at people who peacefully took to the streets without weapons at a rally for their freedom. For our freedom.\n\nThe Russian soldiers do not even know what it is like to be free. They were driven here, to be honest, as if sentenced. Sentenced to death, sentenced to disgrace.\n\nA column of civilians came under fire in the Zaporizhzhia region. There were many children.\n\nFour children were hospitalized. Two are in grave condition.\n\nDuring the day 8 humanitarian corridors worked. Kyiv, Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Vorzel, Bucha, Velyka Dymerka, Mariupol, Lysychansk, Severodonetsk, Popasna and Kreminna. 8 thousand 57 people were rescued. Thank you to everyone who did it, who worked for the people.\n\nWe also managed to deliver 200 tons of humanitarian aid.\n\nI spoke today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Rutte and President of France Emanuel Macron.\n\nWe are coordinating our positions on the eve of important summits in Europe. Meetings of the G7, leaders of NATO and the European Union will take place on March 24. Our position will definitely sound. It will sound, believe me, firmly.\n\nI signed a decree on awarding orders and medals to 105 of our warriors. I am grateful to each of them. 7 of them are, unfortunately, awarded posthumously.\n\nIt was a day of difficult events. Difficult conclusions.\n\nBut it was another day that brought us all closer to our victory.\n\nTo peace for our state.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ',description:"The enemy is slowly trying to move.

To the free south of Ukraine, where the sun shines only to welcome guests, not to random "tourists" on tanks. To Berdyansk, Kakhovka, Enerhodar, Melitopol and, of course, Kherson.\n\nTo Kherson, where today we saw slaves shooting at free people. Slaves of propaganda that replaces their consciousness. Slaves who used to pack everyone in paddy wagons. Even an old woman with a clean white poster. Even a girl with an A4 sheet on which only one word is written - "peace".\n\nThese slaves sent by Russia have never seen so many free people in the squares and streets. They have never seen thousands of people who are not afraid of them, of slaves with weapons in their hands. Slaves perceive freedom as savagery, as danger. They are scared. The fear that propagandists know how to turn into hatred. And then - shots at peaceful free people.\n\nKherson, hold on! We will never forget these shots. Shots from your city. We were all with you in your square and streets. 40 million Ukrainians of our state. Millions and millions of Ukrainians in the world. We\'ve all seen you stand. We’ve seen who you are. We have all felt how you want to regain your freedom. On land, where, watching the Milky Way, the Chumaks went for salt, the enemies felt terrible.\n\nAnd as soon as we can break through to you, every occupier who shot at peaceful Kherson residents just for the blue-yellow color will have a black stripe.\n\nAnd the same awaits the Russian military pale from the fright who were driven out today in Enerhodar. Peaceful Ukrainians drove them out with bare hands.\n\nThe occupiers in Berdyansk, Melitopol and Kakhovka will have a black stripe. Wherever the occupiers kidnap our people. Those who they think are organizing the resistance. But we are not Russia. Remember. And there is no need to organize resistance here. Resistance for Ukrainians is a feature of the soul. And I really want you, all our Ukrainians in the south, to never think even for a moment that Ukraine does not remember you.\n\nWhenever you are in pain, when you resist in spite of everything, please know that our hearts are broken at this time, because we are not with you.\n\nAnd we ask God to support you until we can drive strangers out. This is a feat that you are protesting. This is happiness that we have such people. That we are all Ukraine.\n\nDuring this invasion, heroes have constantly declared themselves among millions of our people. Once - ordinary Ukrainians, and now - fighters. Men and women who stand up for our state. Everywhere: in the south, in the east, in the north, in the center, in the west and abroad. Stand up so that the enemy does not believe that this is a reality.\n\nBut we will make them believe. And we will make them remember that they are not welcome.\n\nAnd they will never be. In Kyiv, which stands bravely and majestically above the Dnieper. In Kharkiv... Proud, tidy, educated Kharkiv. Which they beat, and it does not obey. Chernihiv. Ancient! Chernihiv, which since the time of the Horde has not faced such atrocities committed by the Russian military now.\n\nSumy, Okhtyrka and Lebedyn... Izyum, Derhachi ... Volnovakha, Popasna... Borodyanka, Hostomel, Makariv... Mykolaiv...\n\nMariupol! Hardworking and honest city! Mariupol. Which the occupiers are simply destroying. Destroying to ashes. But it will survive them all. Worthless slaves who do not know how to take care of their own country. Of their own people. And they go to someone else\'s.\n\nWe are fighting for every Ukrainian! And we remember everyone! We are grateful to everyone. Both to the people and to these beautiful cities.\n\nAs well as to Lviv, as well as to Ivano-Frankivsk, Khmelnytskyi, Chernivtsi, Ternopil, Lutsk, our Uzhhorod... Kropyvnytskyi, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih... Vinnytsia, Rivne... Cherkasy, Poltava... Odesa!\n\nThose who may be infrequently mentioned in speeches. But who care about our common future. About Ukraine. And about freedom - for each of us. Who shelter people who have been forced to leave their home. Who work for defense. Who send humanitarian goods. Who deploy the evacuated businesses. Who heal, who help. Help all of us, and therefore themselves.\n\n**Great people of great Ukraine!**\n\nAnd I say this not accidentally - great Ukraine. Because I appeal to everyone in our country and to those abroad. In cities and villages. Those who are free and who are temporarily under occupation. In Crimea, in Donetsk, in Luhansk. Where they must also fight for freedom, not sit and wait.\n\nI appeal to all Ukrainians. Wherever we are. Do everything to protect our state.\n\nTo save our people. Fight. Fight and help. Drive these slaves out! Drive the occupiers out! So that Ukraine lives. So that all of us live with it.\n\n**Free and peaceful.

They opened direct fire from tanks at a nursing home in Luhansk region. In Trostyanets, Sumy region, the occupiers threw a live grenade at civilians. In Kyiv, a shopping center where civilian population were hiding was attacked from the air.\n\nAs a result of the war, millions of Ukrainians were forced to flee their homes. Millions were left homeless. This is our reality that the entire civilized world can already see.\n\nPresident of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced a substantial program to help Ukrainians who were forced to escape from their war-torn towns.\n\nThe Government has embarked on implementation of this program.\n\nMoney, jobs, housing are the three main directions covered by this program.\n\nFirst. Money. The state will pay each displaced in Ukraine a minimum monthly allowance of 2,000 hryvnias. Simply, through the Diia, to the bank account. No extra documents. Avoiding bureaucracy. For all the citizens who moved from areas of active hostilities.\n\nAlso, a 3,000 hryvnias resource will be paid for each child who was forced to move to safer regions because of the war and all those atrocities.\n\nSecond. Jobs. We are launching an employment program for all the displaced persons. To do this, the state commences payment of benefits to those employers who hire IDPs from the affected regions.\n\nA 6,500 hryvnias sum for each employee. These funds will be spent by employers on the salaries for such employees.\n\nI will appeal to entrepreneurs again.\n\nThe state supports you in your desire to continue working where it is safe. Complete deregulation of business, simplification of the tax system, affordable loans.\n\nNow the Government bears part of the resources for paying wages to those people who need work. Hence, let's get work! I urge everyone to start working, to admit people, to provide them with work.\n\nThird. Housing. A week ago, the Government adopted a decision on a mechanism to reimburse utility costs to communities that provide free shelter to IDPs in schools, kindergartens, cultural centers and municipal institutions.\n\nWe are now working to supplement the program so that families receiving displaced persons in their homes can also get compensation for utility bills.\n\nAll those who responded to the hardship the IDPs face, provided them with shelter for free, will receive 450 UAH per month for each of those whom they helped to compensate while paying for utilities.\n\nAll the three programs have already been approved by the Government of Ukraine. Their implementation triggers today, March 21, with the registration of temporary displaced persons by territorial communities and CASPs.\n\nRegistration through the Diia will be available starting March 30.\n\nAnd after the war ends we will rebuild everything. Every building, every apartment, every facility. And everyone will have a chance to return home.\n\nBut everyone who today has found shelter, work and everything necessary for life in this time of trials will forever keep in their hearts the memory of and gratitude to those hospitable communities and people.\n\n**We will never forget that either.**\n\n**Glory to Ukrainians!

They all say so when taken captive. \n\nIt is already the 25th day since the Russian military has been vainly trying to find imaginary “Nazis” from whom they allegedly wanted to defend our people. Just as they are vainly trying to find Ukrainians who would meet them with flowers. At least in one city of our state. At least in one village.\n\nAnd most importantly - the Russian military cannot find a way home. That is why our soldiers help them with the path to God's judgment.\n\nTo God's judgment where I am sure they receive only one punishment, one for all: the eternal cellar. Forever under the bombs. Forever without food, water and heat. For everything they did to our people, ordinary Ukrainians. To peaceful people. In Okhtyrka and Kharkiv, in Borodyanka and Chernihiv. In Volnovakha and Mariupol. And many of our other courageous cities.\n\nIn besieged Mariupol, Russian aircraft dropped a bomb on an art school. People were hiding there. Hiding from shelling, from bombing. There were no military positions. There were about four hundred civilians. Mostly women and children, the elderly. They are under the debris. We do not know how many are alive at the moment.\n\nBut we know that we will definitely shoot down the pilot who dropped that bomb. As we already did to almost a hundred other similar mass murderers.\n\nToday, in the Knesset, I addressed all deputies and government officials. But first of all, I spoke on your behalf, on behalf of all Ukrainians with the people of Israel, who, I am sure, understand us. As free people understand free people.\n\nOf course, Israel has its own interests, a strategy to protect its citizens. We understand that. Israeli Prime Minister Bennett is trying to find a way to negotiate with Russia. And we are grateful for that. For every effort. So that sooner or later we start talking to Russia, perhaps in Jerusalem. This is the right place to find peace. If it is possible.\n\nWell, Russian propagandists today have a rather difficult task.\n\nAfter all, for the first time in history, the president of a foreign state spoke in the Knesset via video call. And spoke to the people of Israel. The President of Ukraine accused in Moscow of \"Nazism” spoke in the Knesset to the people of Israel.\n\nThis fact alone confirms how wrong things are in Moscow.\n\nDuring the day on March 20, only 4 humanitarian corridors worked. A total of 7,295 people were evacuated. Almost 4,000 Mariupol residents arrived in Zaporizhzhia in one day.\n\nTomorrow morning we are preparing to send new buses to Mariupol to continue this important mission. More than 3,000 people were rescued in the Kyiv region. But in the Kharkiv region... Russian troops captured our convoy, our humanitarian cargo for the city of Vovchansk. There is no connection now with six people. Five drivers and one doctor. We will release them. We will try again and again to deliver to our people what they need.\n\nThe Kherson region fought again today. I am grateful to them. Again on the streets. And as always - for all of us, for Ukraine. With national flags. And with our Ukrainian courage. Unarmed against the occupiers. Against shots and military vehicles. This is a feat that inspires us all. This is Ukraine we are proud of. These are Ukrainians to whom I am immensely grateful. Just as all our people are.\n\nIn the afternoon I spoke with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. A true friend of Ukraine who does not hesitate and does not seek excuses.\n\nWe agreed on concrete support for our country at next week's G7 and NATO summits. Although we are not members of these organizations, I see that Ukraine has at least one vote there.\n\nI also spoke with Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis. A star couple who sincerely believe in us, in our victory, in our future. They help Ukrainian IDPs by raising funds. And the two of them have already raised $ 35 million. I thanked them on behalf of our people, on behalf of all of us. Agree, this is a good result for one couple of our friends in America.\n\nAnd we are working to make the whole world our friends.\n\nI personally presented state awards to Ukrainian intelligence officers. Please understand - I can't say their names publicly.\n\nBut believe me, the contribution of these people to our defense is so significant that the orders and the title of Hero of Ukraine for them is the minimum we can give. Just to express gratitude. To them and to all our heroes. Thanks to which we are holding on. And we’re doing it pretty well.\n\n**And Ukraine lives.**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"The Russian military cannot find a way home.

And both times - as a tragedy. A tragedy for Ukrainians, for Jews, for Europe, for the world.\n\nOn February 24, 1920, the National Socialist Workers\' Party of Germany (NSDAP) was founded. A party that took millions of lives. Destroyed entire countries. Tried to kill nations.\n\n102 years later, on February 24, a criminal order was issued to launch a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. The invasion, which has claimed thousands of lives, has left millions homeless. Made them exiles. On their land and in neighboring countries. In Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Germany, the Czech Republic, the Baltic States and dozens of different countries.\n\nOur people are now scattered around the world. They are looking for security. They are looking for a way to stay in peace. As you once searched.\n\nThis Russian invasion of Ukraine is not just a military operation, as Moscow claims. This is a large-scale and treacherous war aimed at destroying our people. Destroying our children, our families. Our state. Our cities. Our communities. Our culture. And everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainians. Everything that Russian troops are now destroying. Deliberately. In front of the whole world.\n\nThat is why I have the right to this parallel and to this comparison. Our history and your history. Our war for our survival and World War II.\n\nListen to what the Kremlin says. Just listen! There are even terms that sounded then. And this is a tragedy. When the Nazi party raided Europe and wanted to destroy everything. Destroy everyone. Wanted to conquer the nations. And leave nothing from us, nothing from you. Even the name and the trace. They called it "the final solution to the Jewish issue". You remember that. And I\'m sure you will never forget!\n\nBut listen to what is sounding now in Moscow. Hear how these words are said again: "Final solution". But already in relation, so to speak, to us, to the "Ukrainian issue".\n\nIt sounded openly. This is a tragedy. Once again, it was said at a meeting in Moscow. It is available on official websites. This was quoted in the state media of Russia. Moscow says so: without the war against us, they would not be able to ensure a "final solution" allegedly for their own security. Just like it was said 80 years ago.\n\n**People of Israel!**\n\nYou saw Russian missiles hit Kyiv, Babyn Yar. You know what kind of land it is. More than 100,000 Holocaust victims are buried there. There are ancient Kyiv cemeteries. There is a Jewish cemetery. Russian missiles hit there.\n\n**People of Israel!**\n\nOn the first day of this war, Russian projectiles hit our city of Uman. A city visited by tens of thousands of Israelis every year. For a pilgrimage to the tomb of Nachman of Breslov. What will be left of all such places in Ukraine after this terrible war?\n\nI am sure that every word of my address echoes with pain in your hearts. Because you feel what I\'m talking about. But can you explain why we still turn to the whole world, to many countries for help? We ask you for help... Even for basic visas...\n\nWhat is it? Indifference? Premeditation? Or mediation without choosing a party? I will leave you a choice of answer to this question. And I will note only one thing - indifference kills. Premeditation is often erroneous. And mediation can be between states, not between good and evil.\n\nEveryone in Israel knows that your missile defense is the best. It is powerful. Everyone knows that your weapon is strong. Everyone knows you\'re doing great. You know how to defend your state interests, the interests of your people. And you can definitely help us protect our lives, the lives of Ukrainians, the lives of Ukrainian Jews.\n\nOne can keep asking why we can\'t get weapons from you. Or why Israel has not imposed strong sanctions against Russia. Why it doesn’t put pressure on Russian business. But it is up to you, dear brothers and sisters, to choose the answer. And you will have to live with this answer, people of Israel.\n\nUkrainians have made their choice. 80 years ago. They rescued Jews. That is why the Righteous Among the Nations are among us.\n\nPeople of Israel, now you have such a choice.\n\n**Thank you!**\n\n**Thank you for everything.**\n    ',description:"Ми відповідаємо мудрістю й хоробрістю на величезну кількість їхньої техніки та відправлених в Україну солдатів.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt_CPMYawQs"},{id:"XD6AM4UkfNY",name:"The situation regarding the Russian invasion is a briefing by Oleksii Arestovych",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Олексій Арестович"],date:"2022-03-20T14:53:28",topics:[],cities:[],text:"The situation regarding the Russian invasion is a briefing by Oleksii Arestovych",description:"The situation regarding the Russian invasion is a briefing by Oleksii Arestovych",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD6AM4UkfNY"},{id:"b551GvdS6Xo",name:"Iryna Vereshchuk on the work of humanitarian corridors planned for March 20",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Ірина Верещук"],date:"2022-03-20T11:22:53",topics:["Гуманітарні коридори"],cities:[],text:"Iryna Vereshchuk on the work of humanitarian corridors planned for March 20",description:"Iryna Vereshchuk on the work of humanitarian corridors planned for March 20",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b551GvdS6Xo"},{id:"oKW2yOwVvtQ",name:"The more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences will be for it",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"https://youtu.be/oKW2yOwVvtQ?t=185",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-20T02:26:26",topics:["Терроризм","Міжнародні санкції","Гуманітарні коридори","Міжнародні переговори","Герої України","Заборона діяльності партій"],cities:["Бородянка","Буча","Бервиці","Богданівка","Бровари","Лисичанськ","Попасна","Сєвєродонецьк","Рубіжне","Бахмут","Запоріжжя"],text:'\n**Our strong people of our indomitable country!**\n\nThe 24th day of Russia\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is over. After eight years of aggression. Ukrainians have proved that they know how to fight more professionally than an army that has been fighting for decades in different regions and under different conditions. We respond with wisdom and courage to the huge number of their equipment and soldiers sent to Ukraine.\n\nThat is why, for example, the Ukrainian Chornobaivka will go down in war history. This is a place where the Russian military and their commanders have shown themselves completely as they are: incompetent, capable of simply driving their people to slaughter. Six times our military destroyed the occupiers near Chornobaivka. Six times! And they still come there.\n\nThe besieged Mariupol will go down in history of responsibility for war crimes. The terror the occupiers did to the peaceful city will be remembered for centuries to come. And the more Ukrainians tell the world about it, the more support we find. The more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences will be for it.\n\nToday I addressed the people of Switzerland.\n\nThis is a special state. It does not elbow its way on the international stage. But when it speaks its word, it is heard by absolutely everyone. Switzerland has backed European Union sanctions against Russia. This means a lot for the Russian state machine. For people who are used to the fact that power is money. Hence, banks. Hence, Switzerland and other countries that help save capital. I am grateful to the President and to the people of Switzerland and to their country for their sincere support in our struggle for life and liberty. For not staying away. And I urged them to take a few more steps.\n\nSo that all Swiss companies that have not yet left the Russian market do so immediately in order not to give a single dollar, franc or euro to a Russian military machine to kill our people.\n\nSo that all those responsible for the war against our state cannot enjoy life in Switzerland, real estate in Switzerland, banks in Switzerland.\n\nOur Armed Forces continue to deter the enemy in all major areas. Inflict unprecedented losses on Russian troops. Some units of the occupiers were destroyed by 80-90%.\n\nIn places of especially fierce battles, the frontline of our defense is simply piled with the corpses of Russian soldiers. And these corpses, these bodies, are not taken away. New units are driven on the offensive through these bodies. Some reserves that the command of the Russian troops collect wherever they can.\n\nWe are well aware that Russia has just a bottomless human resource and a lot of equipment, missiles and bombs.\n\nBut I want to ask the citizens of Russia. What have they done to you over the years that you stopped noticing your losses?\n\nDo the words “son”, “mother”, “father” mean nothing to you anymore?\n\nAlready more than 14 thousand of your soldiers have been killed. This is 14 thousand mothers. This is 14 thousand fathers. These are wives, these are children, relatives and friends. And you don\'t notice it? But there will only be more victims. As long as this war continues. Your war against us, Russia against Ukraine. On our land.\n\nEight humanitarian corridors worked on Saturday. 6623 people were rescued.\n\nDue to the shelling of the occupiers, we were unable to rescue people from Borodyanka, Kyiv region. But we will not abandon these attempts.\n\nUkrainians were evacuated from Bervytsya, Bucha, and Bohdanivka to Brovary.\n\nPeople were taken to Bakhmut from Lysychansk, Popasna, Severodonetsk, and Rubizhne in the Luhansk region.\n\nMore than 4000 Mariupol residents managed to leave for Zaporizhzhia.\n\nUnfortunately, it was not possible to deliver the humanitarian cargo to the cities of the Kherson region. Russian troops blocked the movement of our convoy. Why? Their goal has not changed - in the same way they try to portray in their propaganda that Ukraine has left its citizens without the essentials. As if Russia is constantly saving them from something.\n\nAlthough on February 23 our Kherson residents had more than the regions of Russia itself.\n\nI spoke today with French President Macron. About our interaction. About finding a solution for peace, for the liberation of our territories. To save our people.\n\nI am sure you understand that negotiations are not easy and pleasant. But they are needed. Because it\'s about life.\n\nUkraine has always sought a peaceful solution. The more we are interested in peace now.\n\nBecause we count everyone killed. Because every ruined family, every ruined house matters to us. Because we are Ukrainians, and for us a person is priceless.\n\nToday I signed a decree on awarding 161 of our defenders with state awards of Ukraine. 40 of them posthumously. And the decree on awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to 12 servicemen. 8 of them posthumously.\n\nI also met with warriors of the special unit of the National Police of Ukraine KORD to award them. I thanked them for their service, for the protection of our peaceful cities and for their help to the army.\n\nIn total, during the days of the full-scale war, 70 of our defenders have already been awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. 2180 Ukrainians were awarded orders and medals for courage, for saving brothers-in-arms and civilians, for effective actions in defense of the state.\n\nI am sure I can say on behalf of all our Ukrainian people: we are sincerely grateful to each of you. To each and everyone who defends our state and stops the army of occupiers, which was called one of the few most powerful in the world.\n\nUkrainian poet Lina Kostenko celebrates her birthday on March 19. I sincerely congratulate you. On behalf of all Ukrainians.\n\nAnd let me remind you today her words:\n\n*[Quotes Lina Kostenko’s poem]*\n\nIn fact, each of us has a nation. And we should not think meanly. Especially those whom Ukrainians have given the right to be politicians.\n\nI want to remind all politicians from any camp: wartime shows very well the meanness of personal ambitions of those who try to put their own ambitions, their own party or career above the interests of the state, the interests of the people.\n\nThose who hide somewhere in the rear, but pretend to be the only one who cares about defense.\n\nAny activity of politicians aimed at splitting or collaborating will not succeed. But it will get a tough response.\n\nThat is why the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine decided… Given the full-scale war waged by the Russian Federation and the ties of some political structures with this state, any activity of a number of political parties during the martial law is suspended. Namely: "Opposition Platform - For Life", "Shariy Party", "Nashi", "Opposition Bloc", "Left Opposition", "Union of Left Forces", "State", "Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine", "Socialist Party of Ukraine”, “Socialists” Party, “Volodymyr Saldo Bloc”.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice is instructed to immediately take comprehensive measures to ban the activities of these political parties in the prescribed manner.\n\nEveryone must now take care of the interests of our state, the interests of Ukraine.\n\nBecause it\'s for us.\n\nBecause it is for the sake of life.\n\n**Glory to all our heroes!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine**\n    ',description:"We respond with wisdom and courage to the huge number of Russian equipment and soldiers sent to Ukraine.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKW2yOwVvtQ"},{id:"lI4yXBKoOcA",name:"The more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences for it",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"https://youtu.be/lI4yXBKoOcA?t=185",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-20T02:26:26",topics:["Терроризм","Міжнародні санкції","Гуманітарні коридори","Міжнародні переговори","Герої України","Заборона діяльності партій"],cities:["Бородянка","Буча","Бервиці","Богданівка","Бровари","Лисичанськ","Попасна","Сєвєродонецьк","Рубіжне","Бахмут","Запоріжжя"],text:"The more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences for it",description:"The more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences for it",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI4yXBKoOcA"},{id:"QeetGk_4oWA",name:"Iryna Vereshchuk talks about the results of the work of humanitarian corridors on March 18",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Ірина Верещук"],date:"2022-03-19T20:58:08",topics:["Гуманітарні коридори"],cities:[],text:"Iryna Vereshchuk talks about the results of the work of humanitarian corridors on March 18",description:"Iryna Vereshchuk talks about the results of the work of humanitarian corridors on March 18",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeetGk_4oWA"},{id:"oKW2yOwVvtQ",name:"Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the people of Switzerland",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-19T18:29:49",topics:["Терроризм","Вбиті діти","Міжнародні санкції"],cities:[],text:"\n**Dear Mr. President, dear Ignazio!**\n\nMy greetings to all Swiss friends of Ukraine! To all your beautiful people, the people of Switzerland!\n\nI am grateful to you for supporting our people.\n\nThank you for defending freedom together with all those who value it.\n\nThis is very important now. Nowadays. At a special time period.\n\nAnd especially important - from you.\n\nWhen terror became the national idea of one of the largest nations in the world. The basis of their foreign policy.\n\nWhen the crimes of terrorism are committed not by some outcast or group of persons and not by an organization, but by the state. Which has a nuclear arsenal.\n\nWhen a permanent member of the UN Security Council deliberately destroys everything for which the UN was built. Having unleashed a cruel, bloody, senseless war against us.\n\nBut we now have a chance. A chance to show not only to Russia, but also to any aggressor in the world, any terrorist state, that war will destroy not the victim, but the one who came with it.\n\nAnd, perhaps, this is the last chance for humanity - to stop the wars. Stop the state terror.\n\nAnd I'm telling you now. Switzerland. A state that has a very long history of peace. And an even longer history of influence. In many areas - a decisive influence on the world.\n\nEven before I became President, I was thinking what life of our beloved Ukrainians I would like to see.\n\nI have often been to your country. And I know very well how you live. And one day, standing near Chillon Castle, I asked my friends - we were one company - why can't we live like this?\n\nTo have such a standard of living. A high level. And with the same freedom. In such friendly communities. And with such confidence in our own strength.\n\nAnd I sincerely wanted the Ukrainians to live like the Swiss. So that we can jointly decide everything about our own lives. About our land. Not expecting anything from politicians, unnecessary words, but voting in a referendum.\n\nSo that we can be sure, despite all the financial crises in the world, that our state will withstand and remain a leader. A leader of trust, a leader of stability. A dream for all people. Successful, not very successful - no matter what level, just for all people.\n\nSo that the Ukrainians, like the Swiss, can feel that they live in real communities that care about what is common to all - for the good of all.\n\nMaybe these are all ordinary things to you. For us, these are reforms. And this is the path we are taking and we wanted to take.\n\nAnd we passed the relevant laws. For all this to work. We gave opportunities. Opportunities for our people.\n\nSo that we gradually reach your standard of living.\n\nAnd we did it until the black day. February 24. The day of the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of our land, Ukraine.\n\nAnd then everything changed.\n\nIt has changed for each of us, Ukrainians. I'm sure it has changed for all Europeans. And it has changed for all world democracies.\n\nIt has changed for you, too.\n\nI am grateful to you and your state for supporting us in such a difficult time. I am thankful that you did not stay away, didn't say that it wasn't related to you at all\n\nBecause, in fact, it is impossible to stay away from the fact that in the 21st century, in the heart of Europe, hundreds of rockets and bombs are flying at peaceful cities.\n\nIt is impossible to stay away when the army of the world's largest state, albeit only in size, directs all its deadly potential to destroy us, to destroy hospitals, ordinary schools, churches, universities, maternity hospitals, residential areas.\n\nIt is impossible to be indifferent when children are killed. As of this morning, the Russian army has killed 112 Ukrainian children.\n\nAnd just as I wanted the Ukrainians to live like the Swiss... I also want you to be and become like the Ukrainians. In the fight against evil.\n\nSo that there is no question about banks. About your banks. Where the money of all those who started this war is kept.\n\nIt's painful and it's hard. But it is also a struggle against evil.\n\nIt is necessary to completely freeze all the assets of these people and their accounts. It's a big fight, and you can do it.\n\nI want you to become Ukrainians who feel what it is like when whole cities are destroyed, peaceful cities. Destroyed on the orders of those who like to live in communities - different, European, in your communities, in beautiful Swiss communities.\n\nWho enjoys real estate in your country.\n\nAnd it would be fair to deprive them of this privilege. To deprive of what they are taking from us.\n\nAnd I want you to be as Ukrainians in the issue of business. Business that works in Russia in spite of everything. Despite this war.\n\nDespite all our murdered children. Despite the people killed. Despite the destroyed cities. Like our city of Mariupol, heroic Mariupol, which has been under complete blockade for weeks. Imagine - no food, no water, no electricity. Just under the bombs.\n\n\"Good food. Good life.\" This is the slogan of Nestlé. Your company that refuses to leave Russia. Even now - when there are threats from Russia to other European countries. Not only to us. When there is even nuclear blackmail from Russia.\n\nAnd I want all of you, Swiss people, to become like all of us, Ukrainians. I want us not to lose our common chance now.\n\nA chance to restore peace, a chance to stop any wars in the world. Because when Switzerland is with you, you are definitely successful. Because when Ukraine is with you, you are definitely strong.\n\nLast year we agreed on a big conference with the President of your country. Conference in Lugano. For the sake of economic transformation, for the sake of Ukraine's reforms.\n\nIt was to take place this July. As well as the next summit of the first ladies and gentlemen.\n\nAnd I believe, I know we can hold them. This year. On your land.\n\nFor the restoration and development of Ukraine. So that you have the opportunity to show again and again all the best that is in your hearts. In our hearts.\n\nIn the hearts of all those people who are fighting for freedom and fighting for life.\n\n**I am grateful to you. I am grateful to Switzerland!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Thank you for defending freedom together with all those who value it. This is very important now. Nowadays.

Because we are free people of a free country.\n\nToday, government officials have elaborated the decision to fully reboot the customs service.\n\nCargo for our defense, for our people will be brought into Ukraine as easily as the physics laws allow that. \n\nWe eliminate the whole bureaucracy, all paperwork, VAT, all customs duties. \n\nThe goal is clear - to prevent the human factor from hindering the speedy supply of goods, which are really needed now. \n\nChairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk and profile committees are working to ensure the support of people’s deputies for the innovations. I emphasize: this decision is necessary for the defense of the state, for ensuring normal life during martial law. \n\nI urge certain MPs not to speculate on this issue, as it is for the benefit of our state, not the government or the opposition. We must all work jointly for the sake of our Ukraine, our people. Let’s think about PR after the victory. \n\nAnother important area of government work is helping Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their homes due to hostilities.\n\nI commissioned the Cabinet of Ministers to develop a comprehensive program to support such people, our citizens. Everyone who was deprived of home because of the war. We already have the outlines of this program. The first component is financial. State support for all displaced persons. Adults and children. Government support for jobs for such people - where they are temporarily staying. So that every person, every family has a basis for life.\n\nThe second component is housing. The government is preparing concrete proposals for housing for IDPs right now. And also organizes the reconstruction of destroyed housing after the war.\n\nThe third component is no less important. This is the support for the families who have housed people from areas of hostilities or temporary occupation. At a minimum, they will be reimbursed for the cost of utilities related to the stay of IDPs.\n\nPrime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal will soon explain all the details of such a comprehensive program to support our citizens.\n\nA coordination headquarters has been set up to regulate all issues related to the delivery of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Under the chairmanship of Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak, a meeting was held with Ukrainian ambassadors to intensify the supply of humanitarian goods to Ukraine, primarily to help internally displaced persons.\n\nI also commissioned the government to provide assistance together with the International Committee of the Red Cross to those of our citizens who found themselves abroad after February 24 and need the attention of our state and international organizations.\n\nToday there were seven humanitarian corridors in Ukraine. Six - in the Sumy region, one - in the Donetsk region. More than 9,000 people were evacuated from the besieged Mariupol. In total, more than 180,000 Ukrainians have been rescued by the humanitarian corridors. Hundreds of tons of essential products were delivered.\n\nBut the occupiers continue to block the supply of humanitarian aid to the besieged cities in most areas. This is a totally deliberate tactic. They have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an "argument" for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers.\n\nThis is a war crime. They will be held accountable for this. 100%. Every Russian figure who gives such orders and every Russian soldier who carries out such orders will be identified. And will receive a compulsory one-way ticket to The Hague. To the city where the International Criminal Court is located.\n\nPeople are being rescued from the rubble of the drama theater destroyed by the occupiers in Mariupol, where civilians had been hiding from Russian shelling and bombs. More than 130 people are already on the surface. Some of them are seriously wounded. But at the moment there is no information about the dead.\n\nThanks to the courage and professional training of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the occupation forces were stopped in almost all directions.\n\nHeavy fighting in the Kharkiv region - especially heavy near Izyum. Russian troops have already thrown people from training centers there. Absolutely unprepared contingent. People who can\'t endure half an hour in battle.\n\nKyiv region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region, the south of our state - the army stopped the occupiers. The initial plan of the Russian military to seize our state failed. And it seems that they do not know what else can be done to us. It seems that their military commanders are not able to offer their political leadership anything but cruel and erroneous tactics to exhaust us, to exhaust Ukraine. Nothing but constant strikes at the civilian population, peaceful cities, people, children, missiles, air bombs, shelling from "Grads", "Uragans". Nothing but the destruction of non-military infrastructure - residential buildings, hospitals, schools, churches.\n\nBut this tactic of their military only worsens the situation for the Russian state. Leads to new and new destructive sanctions. Encourages new members to join our anti-war coalition. It allows us to unite even those states that have always tried to remain neutral to put pressure on Russia.\n\nTherefore, negotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine - meaningful, fair and without delay - are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes.\n\nWe have always insisted on negotiations. We have always offered dialogue, offered solutions for peace. Not only during 23 days of invasion.\n\nAnd I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. It\'s time to meet. Time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia\'s losses will be so huge that several generations will not be enough to rebound.\n\nMany words were heard in Moscow today in connection with the anniversary of the seizure of Crimea. A big rally took place. And I want to pay attention to one detail. It is reported that a total of about 200,000 people were involved in the rally in the Russian capital. 100,000 on the streets, about 95,000 at the stadium.\n\nApproximately the same number of Russian troops were involved in the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nJust imagine 14 thousand corpses and tens of thousands of wounded and maimed people at that stadium in Moscow. There are already so many Russian losses as a result of this invasion.\n\nThis is the price of war. In a little more than three weeks. The war must end.\n\nUkraine\'s proposals are on the table.\n\nIn the coming days, I will continue to appeal to the nations of the world to call for peace for Ukraine. My appeal to the Swiss people is ahead, to the people and to the state.\n\nAppeals to Israel, Italy and Japan are also planned. The world hears Ukraine\'s position. The world supports our defenders, defenders of Ukraine.\n\nToday I want to express my sincere gratitude to each defender of our strong Mariupol. Our heroic city, which is experiencing the greatest ordeal in its history, in the history of Ukraine.\n\n* 36th Separate Marine Brigade.\n* 501st Separate Marine Battalion.\n* 1st Separate Marine Battalion.\n* 12th Brigade of the National Guard.\n* And a separate detachment of special purpose "Azov".\n\nI am grateful to each and every one of our defenders of Mariupol. I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine.\n\nAlso at the request of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine I decided to confer the title of Hero of Ukraine upon:\n\n* **Colonel Baranyuk Volodymyr Anatoliyovych**, Commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade.\n* And **Major Prokopenko Denys Hennadiyovych**, Commander of a separate detachment of special purpose "Azov".

That's why we will definitely win!\n\nAll that we have to do now is to bring our victory closer. To work as a single team and a united front. Everyone doing his or her job. The more effort we pursue to win now, the sooner that victory will come.\n\nOur Government has clearly determined as one of the topmost priorities of our work now is to build a strong economic rear for our victory.\n\nIn the last week, we have intensified changes in the economic model along a number of key areas in order to support Ukrainian businesses and simplify at most their activities in times of war.\n\nFirst. Food security issues. We cannot allow Ukrainians to be left without food, so the state will directly buy essential social products from Ukrainian producers. Starting tomorrow, these products will be distributed free of charge to people in those cities that are already under the siege or on the confrontation line.\n\nHow will we implement that? We have compiled a list of key social products: from cereals and grains to canned food and oil. The Ministry for Communities and Territories Development forms a list of cities destinations for these products to be delivered on a daily basis.\n\nLocal military administrations will apply for the amount of such products to cover the needs of each of such cities.\n\nThe Ukrzaliznytsia [Ukrainian Railways company] purchases products and delivers them to the regions in cooperation with the Humanitarian Headquarters.\n\nAs for delivery to the temporarily occupied settlements, we will involve international humanitarian organizations.\n\nI would like to reiterate that the distribution of relevant products will be free of charge for the people. The Government has already alotted UAH 18 billion to Ukrzaliznytsia to ensure the implementation of this and other objectives.\n\nNobody will be left alone in trouble.\n\nThe relevant program will also encourage the development of Ukraine's domestic food production, while the food industry is now becoming one of the key sectors of the economy.\n\nThe second issue. As the President of Ukraine has already announced, we are in fact abolishing the vast majority of permits, except for those related to the country's security.\n\nAgainst the background of the martial law effect, businesses switch to a declarative principle of operation. It means one submits documents through the Diia portal and, without waiting for the decision of the government body, starts working.\n\nPermits will remain for literally several activities, such as handling hazardous waste, drug production, and nuclear energy issues.\n\nEarlier, the Government abolished all inspections that could complicate business activities. Now the maximum freedom of business is a necessary condition for the formation of a strong economy in our country.\n\nThe third issue. Interest-free business lending and easier access to financial resources.\n\nThe Government is lifting all restrictions pertaining to the Affordable Loans at 5-7-9 program. Any Ukrainian business that needs support will be able to get a loan on favorable terms.\n\nFrom now on, the maximum loan amount will be increased to UAH 60 million. At the time of martial law and one month after its completion, the interest rate on loans will be 0%. Currently, the state will pay interest for those who want to make business.\n\nAfter martial law period is over, the interest rate on this program will not exceed 5%. Restrictions regarding the business plan or workplaces, or any other, are also removed.\n\nFourth. The Government has adopted a decision to simplify all customs procedures as much as possible. We aim to create the fastest customs service in the world.\n\nNo paperwork at customs.\n\nAbolishing VAT, customs tax and duties immediately after the adoption and entry into force of amendments to the Customs and Tax Codes.\n\nOn a declarative basis only.\n\nAnyone who wants to abide by the general system pays only VAT, and such clearance procedure should take no more than 15 minutes.\n\nThose who just want to import goods to Ukraine without any customs clearance procedure just fill out the customs declaration in advance and enter.\n\nThe cargoes will travel across the border without any obstacles.\n\nThe resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers has already been endorsed. We expect that the Verkhovna Rada will shortly exempt all goods imported to Ukraine today from customs tax and VAT.\n\nTogether with the tax incentives already supported by the Verkhovna Rada, the aforesaid measures create extremely powerful incentives to support existing businesses and even to open new enterprises.\n\nTherefore, we hold the line. We are working for the sake of victory. We believe in Ukraine and the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\n**Glory to Ukrainians!

After eight years of war in the east.\n\nThe occupiers do not stop burning their national wealth in the war against Ukraine.\n\nI am confident that by attacking us, they will destroy everything that Russian society has achieved over the past 25 years. And they will return to where they once began to rise from, as they say, to the \"the wicked 90's\". But without freedom, without the creative desire of millions of people to work for the development of their state.\n\nThis will be the price of war against Ukraine for Russia.\n\nIt will be a fall for them, a painful fall. And they will feel it even in spite of the \"opium for the people\" from television propagandists.\n\nUnjust and aggressive war always has a high price for the aggressor.\n\nBut no matter what happens to them, it cannot comfort us. It will not resurrect our dead people. It will not restore our cities. It will not heal the emotional wound that will stay with us forever.\n\nWe will rebuild everything - I have no doubt about that. We will become a full member of the EU - each representative of our state works for this 24/7.\n\nBut life will be different, and for many - without the thousands of hearts stopped by this war.\n\nMay the memory of everyone who gave life for Ukraine live forever!\n\nRussian troops have continued treacherous shelling of our peaceful cities and our communities. Lviv, Kyiv and the region, Zhytomyr region, Sumy region, Kharkiv and the region, Chernihiv, cities of Donbas - Severodonetsk, Kramatorsk, our Mariupol... Missile strikes, air bombs, \"Grads\".\n\nWe are shooting down Russian missiles as much as we can. We are destroying their planes and helicopters. And this despite the fact that we do not yet have adequate anti-missile weapons. Advanced weapons. We do not have enough combat aircraft. But we have a goal, pure and fair - to protect our people, our state.\n\nUndoubtedly, we will continue to do everything we can. We will remind some Western leaders even louder that this will be a moral defeat for them, it will destroy their prestige if Ukraine does not receive advanced weapons that will really save the lives of thousands of our people.\n\nRussian missiles will not fall from shotguns, which some are trying to replace really useful supplies with.\n\nToday is a busy day of negotiations for me. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. Charles Michel, President of the European Council. Ukraine's great friend, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Johnson.\n\nThe subject is clear. First, these are concrete steps that will give Ukraine even more strength, not only directly for the defense, but also for the economy. For our people, for Ukrainians who really defend Europe. Here and now. On our land.\n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen has promised to do everything possible to speed up Ukraine's accession to the EU. We reduce bureaucratic processes for our state, which usually take years, to weeks, to months. It's not easy, but we do it. I am sure.\n\nWe also agreed on the EU’s support for Ukrainians who were forced to flee their homes due to the war. For those who are abroad and within our state.\n\nWe agreed on a new macro-financial aid - another 300 million euros for Ukraine. In addition to those on which a decision has already been made.\n\nSecondly, we are discussing the next package of sanctions against Russia. Significant enough. To make them feel that every missile against our state, every bomb, every shot has its price. For the Russian budget, for Russian companies, for Russian ambitions and for specific people who represent the Russian government.\n\nAnd until there is peace for Ukraine, sanctions against Russia must grow steadily.\n\nI am grateful to all public initiatives from around the world that offer restrictions for Russia not only at the state level, but also at the level of societies. In particular, I am grateful to the Swedish Port Workers' Union, which promises not to service vessels connected with Russia. This is right. This is a good example for all public structures, all trade unions and business associations to follow.\n\nIf Russia is not stopped now, if Russia is not punished now, other aggressors in the world will start other wars. In different regions of the world. On different continents. Wherever a state dreams of conquering its neighbors.\n\nWe need to act now so that all other potential aggressors see that war is only a loss and no benefit.\n\nThat is why it is necessary for all Europeans to block ports for all Russian ships. So that all Russian commercial vessels follow the Russian warship.\n\nIt is necessary that all Western companies leave the Russian market and not cover with cheap PR their thirst for profit despite blood, despite war crimes. Like Nestle or Auchan for example.\n\nTo date, humanitarian corridors in the Sumy, Donetsk and Kharkiv regions have been agreed upon. Sumy, Konotop, Trostyanets, Lebedyn, Krasnopillya, Velyka Pysarivka. It is especially difficult from the besieged Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia. The occupiers are doing everything to complicate the movement of people and prevent Ukrainian humanitarian cargo from entering the city. This is outright terror. But we try, we do our best. More than 35,000 people have already been rescued from Mariupol.\n\nRescue work is underway at the site of the bombing by the occupiers of the theater where Mariupol residents hid from shelling, used it as a shelter.\n\nIt is known that as of now, more than 130 people were rescued. But hundreds of Mariupol residents are still under the debris. Despite the shelling, despite all the difficulties, we will continue rescue work.\n\nThe situation in the Kharkiv region is very difficult. The occupiers do not stop trying to destroy our city of Izyum. People in Balakliya are being tortured. Our team is doing everything to organize a working humanitarian corridor to these cities and deliver food, water and medicine.\n\nI instructed the Cabinet of Ministers, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council and the Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada to develop a format of decisions that will speed up the supply of all necessary goods from abroad.\n\nThis is especially topical for food, fuel and other goods that meet the basic needs of society.\n\nWar is not a time for bureaucrats and careerists from different departments to complicate the provision of goods for people. We want to simplify the passage of goods that Ukrainians need now through customs as much as possible.\n\nIf this requires the removal of taxes and excises during martial law, we are ready to do so. If it is necessary to remove customs officers who do not understand the tasks of wartime to act quickly, we will do so.\n\nOur borders must be open to everything Ukrainians need. I am waiting for the appropriate decisions by the end of the day. And then - the support from people's deputies.\n\nBecause now everyone has to work only for Ukrainians, only for our state, for defense. Not for ambitions. Not for fear. Not for bureaucracy.\n\nEverything is for the protection of Ukraine!\n\nToday I signed a decree on the awarding of state awards to 138 servicemen of the Armed Forces. In particular, the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the II degree is awarded to:\n\nSyrskyi Oleksandr Stanislavovych, Commander of the Land Forces. Since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion, he has been leading the defense of Kyiv. Thanks to his professional and courageous actions, the enemy suffered significant losses and was driven away from the capital. During the defense of Kyiv, more than 30 settlements in the Kyiv region, which were temporarily occupied by the enemy, were liberated.\n\nMajor Mazurok Taras Leonidovych, commander of the tank battalion. Defending the Donetsk region, he inflicted significant losses on the enemy and significantly stopped his advance.\n\nSergeant Nutsa Ruslana Vasylivna was awarded the Order of Courage of the III degree. Senior combat medic. She personally took part in the evacuation of the wounded from Vodyane, Shyrokyne and Mariupol. Thanks to her actions, 31 of our defenders were saved. She continues to perform tasks in Mariupol.\n\n**Glory to all our heroes!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"We will rebuild everything - I have no doubt about that.

Which we make smaller every day. Every day. But it still has numbers, equipment and reserves.\n\nWe have information that the Russian military is recruiting mercenaries from other countries, trying to deceive as many young people as possible into military service.\n\nWe know that this will not help them.\n\nSo now I warn everyone who will try to join the occupiers on our Ukrainian land. This will be the worst decision of your life.\n\nLong life is better than the money you are offered for a short one.\n\nOur courageous defenders continue to hold all the key areas that the enemy is pressing. And respond to every attack. To every blow of the occupiers to our peaceful cities, to our people. New Russian conscripts have been taken prisoner.\n\nAmong them are those who refuse to return to Russia. And there are many who are not even mentioned in Russia. They don't even try to take them back.\n\nTheir death notifications have been sent to their families although they are in captivity and alive.\n\nAll Russians who can hear me now, speak about it. Tell it in Russia.\n\nEvery mother who knows that her son was sent to war against Ukraine must check where her son is. And especially those who cannot contact their children, who have been told that their children had been killed. And who didn't receive the bodies. There are phone numbers on the Internet that you can call and find out what is really happening to your children.\n\nWe did not plan to take thousands of prisoners. We do not need 13 or any number of thousands of dead Russian soldiers. We do not need it. We didn't want this war. We only want peace. And we want you to love your children more than you fear your authorities.\n\nI addressed the parliament of Germany today. One of the most influential countries in the world. In Europe. One of the natural leaders of the European continent.\n\nI spoke not just as President, but as a Ukrainian citizen. As a European. As someone who has felt for many years that the German state seems to have fenced itself off us with a wall. Invisible yet solid wall.\n\nWe have seen Germany fight for the economy for decades. For new Russian gas pipelines and old European dreams. Dreams of some kind of cooperation that Russia has not taken seriously for a long time.\n\nWe see that the views of the Germans are changing. And this is very important. We see Germany looking for a new path. We see how sincerely the majority of Germans stand in favor of revising the old policy.\n\nWe see that Chancellor Olaf Scholz has a great chance, a great mission - to give Germany a renewed leadership. Give Europe peace. Long-lasting and most importantly - fair. One that guarantees security to every state in Europe and Ukraine in the first place. And I sincerely wish Chancellor Scholz from all Ukrainians, from all Europeans that Germany and its partners succeed in carrying out this mission.\n\nI will continue such speeches in the parliaments and squares of the partner states. Necessarily. As much as it takes to stop the war. To restore our territorial integrity. To return to all of us, Ukrainians and all Europeans, the long-awaited peace.\n\nI feel that we are being increasingly understood. In Europe, in the world, in different countries. And it gives us more and more support. The one we have been asking for for so long.\n\nI spoke with French President Macron. We are strengthening the defense of Ukraine. We coordinated our joint steps towards peace. I’m grateful for that.\n\nI am also grateful to President Biden for his new and effective support for our country. Please, understand: I can't reveal all the details of this support package and others to you. Because this is our tactic. Our defense. When the enemy does not know what to expect from us. Just as they did not know what would await them after February 24. Didn't know what we had for the defense and how we were preparing to face the attack.\n\nThe occupiers thought they were going to Ukraine, which they had seen before, in 2014-2015. Which they constantly corrupted and which they were not afraid of. But we are different.\n\nAnd this allows us to defend ourselves against a full-scale strike for 22 days already. Everything we have done in a few years. For our defense. For our tactics. For defense tactics, which is not the time to reveal while the war is going on.\n\nIt is not the time to reveal our tactics of negotiations as well. Negotiations for peace, sovereignty, territorial integrity of our state, our freedom. Working more in silence than on television, radio or Facebook. I think this is right.\n\nToday I visited the wonderful Vlasenko family from Vorzel, Kyiv region, at the hospital.\n\nEscaping, they got under Russian shelling. The eldest daughter, Katya, who is only 16 years old, covered her brother Ihor, who is 8. The brother got out of the car and cursed the occupiers. Tetiana, mother, received shrapnel wounds. The father carried his daughter in his arms.\n\nThank God they all survived. Because they stayed together, as a family, and defended each other. I was really moved to talk to them. Probably the most during this war. I sincerely wish health and happiness to this family, the Vlasenko family. Like all other families. I wish you peace and work for it.\n\nAlso today, I awarded five employees of the State Emergency Service with the Order of Courage. Everyone is a hero. Everyone was awarded for selfless actions, for dedication with which they save all of us, save Ukrainians.\n\nAnd some more news, very important and, of course, positive. About our economy. About how we bring our country back to life. Right now, wherever security allows. Wherever business can run.\n\nOur government has already prepared a decision to expand the lending program for entrepreneurs on the basis of the program \"5-7-9%\" creating a new opportunity. Any business will be able to get a loan at 0%. For the time of martial law plus 1 month after the war.\n\nThen there will be a minimum rate of 5%. And the total loan amount can be up to 60 million hryvnias. So that a wider range of businesses can take advantage of our program.\n\nThe second news is that the Cabinet of Ministers will vote tomorrow for a large-scale reduction of regulations.\n\nThere were more than 600 permits and licenses for business, and about 20 remain mandatory. Only those that simply cannot be revoked. For example, radioactive waste management.\n\nSo, for the vast majority of businesses in Ukraine, the declarative principle will work: you have announced the start of business and you work freely.\n\nAnd the third news, which concerns millions of Ukrainians. This is a special task for the National Bank of Ukraine, for people's deputies and our government officials.\n\nI instructed to find such a legislative opportunity for the state to guarantee 100% of deposits in Ukrainian banks. 100%. Not part, as now, as always, but 100%.\n\nThe whole deposit. In any bank of our state. So that people do not lose money and are not afraid of it under any circumstances.\n\nSo I'm waiting for specifics. Draft decision. And I hope that the Verkhovna Rada will not delay the support.\n\nBecause Ukrainians need it. Ukraine needs this.\n\nAnd finally.\n\nOur Mariupol, our Kharkiv, our Chernihiv, Kyiv region, Izyum and all our hero cities. Which are in a very difficult situation. Extremely difficult.\n\nWe are doing everything. All of us. Absolutely.\n\nOur army, police, SES, humanitarian convoys, church... All our people.\n\nWe will not leave you. And we will not forgive them.\n\nYou will be free. Definitely. I know it.

Everything - houses, hospitals, schools, churches. Using missiles, air bombs, rocket artillery.\n\nThousands of Ukrainians died in three weeks. The occupiers killed 108 children. In the middle of Europe, in our country, in 2022.\n\nI am addressing you after numerous meetings, negotiations, statements and requests. After steps in support, some of which are overdue. After sanctions, which are obviously not enough to stop this war. And after we saw how many ties your companies still have with Russia. With a state that just uses you and some other countries to finance the war.\n\nDuring the three weeks of war for our lives, for our freedom, we became convinced of what we had felt before. And what you probably do not all notice yet.\n\nYou are like behind the wall again. Not the Berlin Wall. But in the middle of Europe. Between freedom and slavery. And this wall grows stronger with each bomb that falls on our land, on Ukraine. With every decision that is not made for the sake of peace. Not approved by you, although it may help.\n\nWhen did it happen?\n\n**Dear politicians.**\n\n**Dear German people.**\n\nWhy is this possible? When we told you that Nord Stream was a weapon and a preparation for a great war, we heard in response that it was an economy after all. Economy. Economy. But it was cement for a new wall.\n\nWhen we asked you what Ukraine needs to do to become a member of NATO, to be safe, to receive security guarantees, we heard the answer: such a decision is not on the table yet and will not be in the near future. Just as the chair for us at this table. Just as you are still delaying the issue of Ukraine's accession to the European Union. Frankly, for some it is politics. The truth is that it is stones. Stones for a new wall.\n\nWhen we asked for preventive sanctions, we appealed to Europe, we appealed to many countries. We turned to you. Sanctions for the aggressor to feel that you are a force. We saw delays. We felt resistance. We understood that you want to continue the economy. Economy. Economy.\n\nAnd now the trade routes between you and the country that has once again brought a brutal war to Europe are barbed wire over the wall. Over the new wall that divides Europe.\n\nAnd you don't see what's behind this wall, and it's between us, between people in Europe. And because of this, not everyone is fully aware of what we are going through today.\n\nI am addressing you on behalf of Ukrainians, I am addressing you on behalf of Mariupol residents - civilians of a city that Russian troops have blocked and razed to the ground. They just destroy everything there. Everything and everyone who is there. Hundreds of thousands of people are under shelling around the clock. No food, 24 hours a day without water, no electricity, 24 hours a day without communication. For weeks.\n\nRussian troops do not distinguish between civilians and military. They don’t care where civilian objects are, everything is considered a target.\n\nA theater that was a shelter for hundreds of people and was blown up yesterday, a maternity hospital, a children's hospital, residential areas without any military facilities - they are destroying everything. Round the clock. And they do not let any humanitarian cargo into our blocked city. For five days, Russian troops have not stopped the shelling specifically to prevent the rescue of our people.\n\nYou can see it all. If you climb over this Wall.\n\nIf you remember what the Berlin Airlift meant to you. Which could be realized because the sky was safe. You were not killed from the sky as now in our country, when we cannot even make an airlift! When the sky gives only Russian missiles and air bombs.\n\nI am addressing you on behalf of older Ukrainians. Many survivors of World War II. Those who escaped during the occupation 80 years ago. Those who survived Babyn Yar.\n\nBabyn Yar that President Steinmeier visited last year. On the 80th anniversary of the tragedy. And that was hit by Russian missiles now. It is exactly this place that was hit. And the missile strike killed the family that went to Babyn Yar, to the monument. Killed again, 80 years after.\n\nI appeal to you on behalf of everyone who has heard politicians say: \"Never again.\" And who saw that these words are worthless. Because again in Europe they are trying to destroy the whole nation. Destroy everything we live by and live for.\n\nI am addressing you on behalf of our military. Those who defend our state, and therefore the values that are often talked about everywhere in Europe, everywhere - and in Germany as well.\n\nFreedom and equality. Opportunity to live freely, not to submit to another state, which considers a foreign land its \"living space\". Why are they defending all this without your leadership? Without your strength? Why are overseas states closer to us than you are?\n\nBecause this is the Wall. The wall that someone doesn't notice and that we are hammering on while fighting to save our people.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**German people!**\n\nI am grateful to everyone who supports us. I am grateful to you. Ordinary Germans who sincerely help Ukrainians on your land. To journalists who do their job honestly, showing all the evil that Russia has brought to us. I am grateful to the German businessmen who put morality and humanity above accounting. Above the economy. Economy. Economy. And I am grateful to the politicians who are still trying... Trying to break this Wall. Who choose life between Russian money and the deaths of Ukrainian children. Who support the strengthening of sanctions against Russia that can guarantee peace. Peace to Ukraine. Peace to Europe. Who do not hesitate to disconnect Russia from SWIFT.\n\nWho know that an embargo on trade with Russia is needed. On imports of everything that sponsors this war. Who know that Ukraine will be in the European Union. Because Ukraine is already more Europe than many others.\n\nI am grateful to everyone who is taller than any wall. And who knows that the stronger one bears more responsibility when it comes to saving people.\n\nIt is difficult for us to endure without the help of the world, without your help. It is difficult to defend Ukraine, Europe without what you can do. So that you don’t look over your shoulder even after this war. After the destruction of Kharkiv... For the second time in 80 years. After the bombing of Chernihiv, Sumy and Donbas. For the second time in 80 years. After thousands of people tortured and killed. For the second time in 80 years. Otherwise, what is the historical responsibility to the Ukrainian people still not redeemed for what happened 80 years ago?\n\nAnd now - so that a new one does not appear, behind the new Wall, which will again demand redemption.\n\nI appeal to you and remind you of what is needed. The things without which Europe will not survive and will not preserve its values.\n\nFormer actor, President of the United States Ronald Reagan once said in Berlin: Tear down this wall!\n\nAnd I want to tell you now.\n\nChancellor Scholz! Tear down this wall.\n\nGive Germany the leadership you deserve. And what your descendants will be proud of.\n\n**Support us.**\n\n**Support peace.**\n\n**Support every Ukrainian.**\n\n**Stop the war.**\n\n**Help us stop it.**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Thousands of Ukrainians died in three weeks.

Our Ukrainian Melitopol, which did not submit and will not submit to the occupiers. Ivan Fedorov is free. I talked to him today. The Russian military abducted him on March 11, trying to persuade him to collaborate. But our man withstood. He did not give up. Just as we all endure. You all. Just as we all do not give up. Because we are Ukrainians. And we always protect our own. \n\nToday a protest action took place in Berdyansk again. Protest against the occupiers from the Russian Federation. Thousands of brave civilians came out against the armed Russian military. And they told them everything, everything they deserve. It is very important.\n\nI know it's hard. But it is also important that what they heard from our people, including in Russian, is clear and unambiguous: occupiers, go home.\n\nThere is still such an opportunity. Every soldier thrown into the territory of our country has such an opportunity. Everyone who has not yet been killed, wounded or taken prisoner.\n\nRussian troops suffer such losses in Ukraine, which were inflicted neither in Syria, nor in Chechnya. Neither did the Soviet troops suffer such losses in Afghanistan. If your war, the war against the Ukrainian people, continues, the mothers of Russia will lose more children than in the Afghan and Chechen wars combined. What’s the point of it?\n\nEvery Russian soldier who lays down weapons will get a chance, a chance to survive.\n\nI appeal specifically to the conscripts who were thrown into the furnace of this war. Not your war. And to the rest of the Russian soldiers who still have the instinct of self-preservation.\n\nLay down your weapons. It's better than dying on the battlefield, on our land.\n\nUnfortunately, the humanitarian corridors did not work on Wednesday. The Russian military did not stop shelling, did not guarantee security.\n\nWe are ready to ensure silence. We are ready to take people out and send humanitarian aid. But we can't expose people to shelling on the road. Understand us. Expose to the fact that for the Russian military there is no such war crime, which they would not commit.\n\nWe are taking away Mariupol residents who managed to escape to Berdyansk... We are taking them to Zaporizhzhia. In total, more than 6,000 Mariupol residents were transported in one day, more than 2,000 of them are children.\n\nThe Russian military tried to disrupt this movement as well. They opened mortar fire on the section of the road between Vasylivka and Kamyanske in the Zaporizhzhia region. Only by a miracle there were no casualties. Five Ukrainians were wounded, including two children.\n\nIn Chernihiv, the occupiers fired at civilians who were simply standing in line for bread. Imagine. Ten dead people.\n\nIn Mariupol, in besieged Mariupol, Russian aircraft purposefully dropped a huge bomb on the Drama Theater in the city center. Hundreds of people were hiding from the shelling there... The building was destroyed. The death toll is still unknown. Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people. To our Mariupol. To the Donetsk region...\n\nCitizens of Russia! How is your blockade of Mariupol different from the blockade of Leningrad during World War II? Who do you inherit?\n\nWe will not forget anyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers. We will not forgive any murdered soul. Eternal memory to all victims of this terror! To all the victims of the war unleashed by the Russian state.\n\nWhat else do the occupiers have to do, how many more people do they have to kill in order for Western leaders, NATO leaders to respond positively to Ukraine's request for a no-fly zone or for providing our country with the aircraft we so desperately need?\n\nI spoke about this today in a speech to the United States Congress.\n\nUkraine has received strong support from our American friends. And I'm grateful to President Biden for that. I am grateful for the leadership that has united the democratic world.\n\nBut the war does not end. Russia's war crimes do not stop. The Russian economy is still able to maintain their military machine. That is why new packages of sanctions against Russia are needed. The world must finally officially recognize that Russia has become a terrorist state.\n\nAnd most importantly, Ukraine needs to get more support. Even more than we get now. Air defense systems. Aircraft. Enough lethal weapons and ammunition to stop the Russian occupiers.\n\nIt was in this speech in Congress that I addressed both the United States and all the relevant states as regards creating a new U-24 union.\n\nA new alliance that will ensure that each aggressor receives a coordinated response from the world. Fast and efficient. Immediately. Not in weeks, months, years, but in the first 24 hours after the attack.\n\nWe can no longer trust the existing institutions. We cannot expect bureaucrats in international organizations to change so quickly. Therefore, we must look for new guarantees. Create new tools. Take those who have courage and do what justice requires. We have already proved that we can do historical things. This is not just our resistance. Not just defense.\n\nEven at this time - the biggest test for Ukraine - we managed to join the European energy network. Now Ukraine can use electricity flows from the European Union. We have been moving towards this for decades. It finally happened! I am grateful to all the power engineers of our country, to all those who worked for this result.\n\nWe are already working on programs to restore our country after the war.\n\nI promise everyone, every Ukrainian who has lost home, who has lost an apartment as a result of hostilities or shelling that the state will restore everything. Restore independently.\n\nI am confident that we will be able to rebuild our state quickly. Whatever the damage may be... It will be a historic reconstruction. A project that will inspire the world just as our struggle for our freedom. Just as our struggle for our Ukraine.\n\nDuring the day I spoke with friends of Ukraine - President of Turkey Erdoğan and Prime Minister of Canada Trudeau. I thanked them for their support. We agreed on new steps for the sake of peace for our country.\n\nIn a conversation with the Prime Minister of Ireland, I expressed condolences over the murder by the Russian military of an Irish citizen - journalist Pierre Zakrzewski.\n\nI also spoke with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. We agreed on the support for our citizens - temporary displaced persons.\n\nI will address the German Parliament on Thursday morning. I will continue to fight for even greater support for Ukraine, for even greater pressure on Russia. For the sake of our common victory, for the sake of peace for us.\n\nFor the sake of peace for us, the Ukrainian delegation speaks with the Russian delegation. And I want all our citizens, citizens of Ukraine, to hear me now.\n\nNegotiations are ongoing. Negotiations for the sake of Ukraine.\n\nMy priorities in the negotiations are absolutely clear: the end of the war, security guarantees, sovereignty, restoration of territorial integrity, real guarantees for our country, real protection for our country.\n\n**Glory to all our heroes!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"We will not forget anyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers.

Friends!**\n\nI am proud to greet you from Ukraine, from our capital - Kyiv. From a city that is under missile and air strikes by Russian troops. Daily. But it does not give up. And it didn't even think to give up for a single minute! Just as dozens of other cities and communities in our country, which found themselves in the worst war since World War II.\n\nI have the honor to greet you on behalf of the Ukrainian people, brave and freedom-loving people. For eight years they have been resisting the aggression of the Russian Federation. They sacrifice the best children - sons and daughters to stop the full-scale Russian invasion.\n\nNow the fate of our state is being decided. The fate of our people. It is being decided whether Ukrainians will be free. Whether they will preserve their democracy.\n\nRussia has attacked more than just our land and our cities. It went on a brutal offensive against our values. Basic human values. It threw tanks and planes against our freedom. Against our right to live freely in our country, choosing our own future. Against our desire for happiness. Against our national dreams. Just like yours, ordinary people of America. Just like those of everyone in the United States.\n\nI remember your Rushmore National Memorial. The faces of your prominent presidents. Those who laid the foundations of America. As it is today. Democracy, independence, freedom and care for everyone. Everyone who works diligently. Who lives honestly. Who respects the law.\n\nWe in Ukraine want the same for ourselves. All that is a normal part of life for you.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**Americans!**\n\nIn your great history you have pages that will allow you to understand Ukrainians. Understand us now. When it is needed most.\n\nRemember Pearl Harbor. Terrible morning of December 7, 1941. When your sky was black from the planes attacking you. Just remember that.\n\nRemember September 11th. A terrible day in 2001, when evil tried to turn your cities into a battlefield. When innocent people were attacked. Attacked from the air. In a way no one expected.\n\nIn a way you could not stop it. Our state experiences this every day! Every night! For three weeks now! Different Ukrainian cities... Odesa and Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, Zhytomyr and Lviv, Mariupol and Dnipro. Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death. For thousands of people.\n\nRussian troops have already fired nearly a thousand missiles at Ukraine. Countless bombs. They use drones to kill more precisely. This is a terror Europe has not seen for 80 years!\n\nAnd we ask for a response. For the response from the world. For the response to terror. Is this too much of a request?\n\nTo establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine is to save people. Humanitarian no-fly zone. Conditions under which Russia will no longer be able to terrorize our peaceful cities every day and night. If that's too much, we offer an alternative.\n\nYou know what defense systems we need. C-300 and other similar systems.\n\nYou know how much depends on the battlefield on the ability to use aircraft. Powerful, strong aircraft. To protect your people. Your freedom. Your land. Aircraft that can help Ukraine. That can help Europe.\n\nAnd you also know that they are available. But on land. Not in the Ukrainian sky. They do not protect our people.\n\n\"I have a dream\" - these words are known to each of you. Today I can say: I have a necessity. The necessity to protect our sky. The necessity for your decision. Your help. And it will mean exactly the same thing. The same thing you feel. When you hear: I have a dream.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**Friends!**\n\nUkraine is grateful to the United States for its overwhelming support. For all that your state and your people have already done for our freedom. For weapons and ammunition, for training and funding, for leadership in the free world, which helps put pressure on the aggressor economically.\n\nI am grateful to President Biden for his personal involvement, for his sincere commitment to the defense of Ukraine and democracy around the world.\n\nI am grateful to you for the resolution, which recognizes all those who commit crimes against the Ukrainian people as war criminals.\n\nHowever, now, in the darkest time for our country, for the whole of Europe, I urge you to do more! New packages of sanctions are needed every week. Until the Russian military machine stops. Restrictions are needed as regards everyone on whom this unjust regime is based.\n\nWe offer the United States to impose sanctions against all politicians in the Russian Federation who remain in office and do not sever ties with those responsible for the aggression against Ukraine. From State Duma deputies to the last official who lacks the morale to sever ties with state terror. All American companies must leave Russia, their market. Leave this market flooded with our blood.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen.**\n\n**Members of Congress!**\n\nTake the lead! If you have companies in the constituencies that sponsor the Russian military machine, keeping their business in Russia... You have to put pressure. So that the Russian state does not receive a single dollar, which it spends on the destruction of Ukraine. On the destruction of Europe.\n\nAll American ports must be closed to Russian goods and ships. Peace is more important than profit. And we must defend this principle throughout the world together.\n\nWe have already become part of the anti-war coalition. The great anti-war coalition, which unites many states, dozens of states. Those who reacted in a principled manner to President Putin's decision - to Russia's invasion of our state.\n\nBut we have to move on. We have to create new tools. To respond quickly! And stop the war. The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine began on February 24. And it would be fair if it ended in a day. In 24 hours. So that evil is punished immediately. Today the world does not have such tools.\n\nThe wars of the past have prompted our predecessors to create institutions that were supposed to protect us from war. But... They don't work. We see it. You see it. So, we need new ones. New institutions. New alliances.\n\nAnd we offer them.\n\nWe offer to create an association - U-24. United for peace. A union of responsible states that have the strength and conscience to stop conflicts. Immediately. Provide all necessary assistance in 24 hours. If necessary - weapons. If necessary - sanctions. Humanitarian support. Political support. Funding. Everything necessary to preserve peace quickly. To save lives.\n\nIn addition, such an association could provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters, man-made disasters. Who fell victim to a humanitarian crisis or epidemic.\n\nRemember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest thing - to give everyone vaccines. Vaccines against Covid. To save lives. To prevent new strains. The world spent months and years doing things that could have been done much faster. So that there were no human losses.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen!**\n\n**Americans!**\n\nIf such an alliance, the U-24, had already been formed, I believe it would have saved thousands of lives. In our country, many other countries that need peace so crucially, that suffered inhuman destruction... I ask you to watch one video now. Video of what Russian troops did on our land. We have to stop this. We must prevent such things. Preventively destroy every aggressor who seeks to conquer another nation.\n\nPlease watch...\n\nAnd in the end to sum it up.\n\nToday it is not enough to be the leader of the nation.\n\nToday it takes to be the Leader of the world. Being the Leader of the world means to be the Leader of Peace.   \n\nPeace in your country does not depend anymore only on you and your people.\n\nIt depends on those next to you, on those who are strong.\n\nStrong does not mean big. Strong is brave and ready to fight for the life of his citizens and citizens of the world.\n\nFor human rights, for freedom, for the right to live decently and to die when your time comes, not when it is wanted by someone else, by your neighbor.       \n\nToday the Ukrainian people are defending not only Ukraine, we are fighting for the values of Europe and the world, sacrificing our lives in the name of the Future.\n\nThat’s why today the American people are helping not just Ukraine, but Europe and the world to keep the planet alive, to keep justice in history.\n\nNow I am almost 45 years old. Today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating. I see no sense in life if it cannot stop death. And this is my main mission as the Leader of my people – great Ukrainians.\n\nAnd as the Leader of my nation I am addressing President Biden.  \n\nYou are the Leader of the nation, of your great nation.\n\nI wish you to be the Leader of the world. Being the Leader of the world means to be the Leader of Peace.\n\nThank you.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Now the fate of our state is being decided. The fate of our people.

There must be an international tribunal. And it will be. For everything they did against Ukraine. Against our people. For every act of terrorism of Russian troops on the territory of our state.\n\nThe Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine and law enforcement agencies have already started this work. The launch of the activity of the investigative group of the International Criminal Court in Ukraine is also important, which together with our law enforcement officers is already collecting all the evidence, collecting the facts of war crimes of the invaders on the territory of our state. So that they receive the legal answer - legal and concrete.\n\nI spoke with Karim Khan, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. He is already in Ukraine, he has already started working. Therefore, the invaders will be responsible for all war crimes against Ukrainians.\n\nLast night, Russian troops continued shelling Ukrainian territory, our peaceful cities, our citizens. Kharkiv and the region... They bombed the coast of the Odesa region. They fired missiles at Kyiv. Hit civilian infrastructure of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nAs of this morning, 103 children have been killed.\n\nRussian troops have now inflicted hundreds of times more damage on Ukraine than on Donbas in eight years of war. And the territories of Donbas, border regions in the Russian direction, Kyiv region and the south of Ukraine suffered the most. The most affected areas are those that Russian propagandists have always spoken of as the place of residence of people especially close to Russia.\n\nApparently, there are no non-nuclear weapons that the invaders have not yet used against our civilians. That's their closeness. That’s their friendship. That’s, as they said in Moscow, \"a divided nation.\"\n\nA total of 400 educational institutions have been destroyed in Ukraine to date, the largest number is in the Donetsk region - 119. In Mariupol, the invaders seized a hospital, a regional intensive care hospital. Already damaged by Russian bombs. Patients and doctors are in captivity. Residents of neighboring houses were forced to go inside the hospital as well. More than 400 people are hostages!\n\nAnd the invaders are using the hospital as a firing position to shell the city.\n\nThis regular crime of the Russian military against Mariupol is no different from Basayev's seizure of the hospital in Budyonnovsk. Although... It is different. Now it's even more treacherous.\n\nLast night, the invaders took hostage six people in the Bucha City Council.\n\nA Ukrainian rescuer who was captured in an agreed humanitarian corridor is being held hostage! The mayors of several of our cities, activists, a journalist are being held hostage... The Russian state has become an outspoken terrorist. And it is not ashamed. But it will be responsible for everything.\n\nThe world is already beginning to understand that without the recognition of Russia as a terrorist state, it will be impossible to restore justice for Ukraine, it will be impossible to restore international order.\n\nToday I signed an important decree on a nationwide minute of silence to honor the memory of all Ukrainians who died in our patriotic war. All those we lost because of the Russian invasion. Because of the terror committed by the invaders .\n\nEvery morning at 9 am in the whole territory of our state we will remember the Ukrainians who gave their lives. All who fought. All military and all civilians. Adults and children... Everyone! All those who could still be alive if Russia had not started this war.\n\nMay the memory of everyone who died for Ukraine live forever!\n\nThe losses of the invaders continue to grow.\n\nThe number of killed enemy soldiers is already approaching 14,000. Tens of thousands of Russian servicemen were wounded. They have already lost more than a hundred helicopters. Soon there will be hundreds of lost planes.\n\nMore than 400 Russian tanks were destroyed, plus several thousand units of other equipment.\n\nWe take abandoned enemy equipment from the battlefield and use it to protect our state and our people.\n\n**Ukrainians!**\n\nIf you know where the enemy is and where he abandoned his tanks or other armored vehicles, ordnance, inform the Ukrainian forces. Let's use everything for our victory! And for the sake of victory be wise.\n\nDon't publish details of our air defense work when you hear the guys work. Do not publish maps that you find in abandoned Russian vehicles and in the broken command posts of the invaders. Please give them to our military. Let them use it to make the enemy suffer!\n\nToday at 3 pm Kyiv time I will address the Congress of the United States of America.\n\nThis will be an important speech. A speech from all of us, from each of our defenders, from each of our citizens. Addressed to the most powerful democracy in the world. To the state and the people who can do a lot to stop Russian aggression, to restore peace on our land.\n\nEight years ago, on this day, the Russian state organized a fake \"referendum\" on the territory of our Ukrainian Crimea. Which it later used to justify the seizure of our territory. It was illegal. This was the destruction of the entire security architecture in Europe, which was created after World War II. But Russia went for it.\n\nIf then there had been at least a hint of such resistance, which we are showing now, which you are showing now... If then the world had reacted at least half as it should react now and reacts... I'm sure we would have had neither this invasion, nor eight years of war in Donbas. All this evil was born from the occupation of Crimea. From our weakness, the brutal actions of Russia, for which it should have been punished already in 2014.\n\nWe are much stronger now, we are united. Now we are a great nation.\n\nBut... We don't have a time machine and we can't go back to the moment when everything was decided.\n\nWe can and must fight today, now. We can and must protect our state, our Ukrainian life. We can and must hold negotiations on a just and fair peace for Ukraine. On the real security guarantees that will work.\n\nThis is an ambitious task. A difficult one. This is a long way. But I am sure that we, Ukrainians, can do all this. We, Ukrainians, can win. And return to peace.\n\nTo the peace we all so strive for.\n\n**Glory to our heroes!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"We are stepping up work to bring the invaders to justice.

The third week is about to be over. We all want peace. As soon as possible. We all want to win. And there is always a feeling that a little more, and we will get what belongs to us, Ukraine, by right. But...\n\nBut efforts are still needed. It takes patience. We still have to fight. And work - everyone in their place. Everyone. In particular, our representatives, our delegation in negotiations with the Russian Federation. It is important. It is difficult, but important, because any war ends in an agreement. Meetings continue. As I am told, the positions in the negotiations sound more realistic. However, time is still needed for the decisions to be in Ukraine's interests.\n\nOur heroes, our defenders give us this time. Defending Ukraine everywhere. Wherever the enemy wants to break through.\n\nThe invaders did not succeed today. Although thousands of their people were thrown into battle.\n\nIn the north and east, in the south of our state. The enemy lost equipment, hundreds of soldiers... Many Russian conscripts died. Dozens of officers. One more general is among the killed invaders. At least one general today.\n\nThe invaders also committed new and obvious war crimes. They fired at peaceful cities and civilian infrastructure. The number of missiles that Russia has used against Ukraine already exceeds 900. There are so many air bombs that it is impossible to count them.\n\nTwo more journalists were killed in an artillery strike by Russian troops. Ukrainian Oleksandra Kuvshynova and Fox News representative Pierre Zakrzewski. Another journalist was heavily wounded. The shelling took place in the Kyiv region.\n\nAnd this is another big reason to tighten Western sanctions against the Russian Federation. Tighten until the Russian state stops the war.\n\nCitizens of Russia! Any of you who have access to truthful information could already understand how this war will end for your country. Shame and poverty. Years of isolation. A very cruel repressive system that will treat the citizens of Russia in the same inhumane way as you, invaders, treated Ukrainians. What happens next depends on your actions.\n\nI want to speak directly to all the officials of the Russian Federation, to everyone who is related to the current government: if you remain in office, if you do not oppose the war, the international community will deprive you of everything. Everything you have earned over the years. This is already being done.\n\nThe same goes for the propaganda system. The fourth branch of power in Russia. If you stay to work for propaganda, you are putting yourself at much greater risk than if you just leave. Just quit. The risk of sanctions and an international tribunal for propaganda of an aggressive war, for justifying war crimes.\n\nQuit! A few months without a job is definitely better for you than a lifetime of international persecution.\n\nToday the Prime Ministers of the three partner states and the three friendly states of Ukraine visited Kyiv. Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. Poland was also represented by Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński and the Prime Minister of Poland.\n\nI was glad to meet, to talk directly, in person, in our capital. This is important support. When our Kyiv is a target for the invaders, it is especially important and especially courageous to be here, next to us, next to friends. This is how leadership is shown.\n\nAnd I invite all friends of Ukraine to visit Kyiv. It can be dangerous here. It is true. Because our sky is not yet closed to Russian missiles and planes.\n\nThe decision to strengthen our arsenal in the air has not yet been made. We have not received planes. But...\n\nYou know for sure that the eyes of all the people of the world are now focused on our capital, on Ukrainians. So everyone who is with us will receive gratitude. Not only ours, but also of other nations of the world. Everyone who is with us has a chance to become a real hero.\n\nI addressed the Canadian Parliament. In fact, in front of the entire political community of this country - our friend. In front of all Canadians. I thanked them for their support - really sincere support. Canada was among the first to come to the rescue of Ukraine. And I called on Canadians to maintain that leadership.\n\nHelp Ukraine. Not in words, but in deeds: weapons, new sanctions against Russia. As well as an active moral position. A position as regards all international businesses that still stay in Russia, that do not leave. Although they fully understand that they are sponsoring the war, sponsoring terror.\n\nMy address to the United States Congress is scheduled for Wednesday. An important event.\n\nAnd today I would like to thank President Biden and all the friends of Ukraine in the United States for the new $13.6 billion package of support for our country, our people. The law providing for this funding has been signed. We consider it as the first step towards the full restoration of Ukraine.\n\nThe Verkhovna Rada also met today. The meeting was effective.\n\nEconomic innovations have been approved - tax cuts that should save jobs and allow Ukraine's business to work. Wherever possible.\n\nThere is a zero rate of excise duty and 7% VAT on fuel to stabilize prices and ensure supply.\n\nBusiness regulation is simplified as much as possible. We are reducing the activities of control bodies so that there are no unnecessary inspections for those who work in accordance with Ukrainian law and do not violate consumer rights.\n\nThe new law also provides the necessary guarantees for the territorial defense warriors - all volunteers will be recognized as combat veterans.\n\nA technical decision was made to continue martial law. This is needed to effectively defend the state.\n\nAlso all nuances of police activity during martial law are settled. I am waiting for the adopted laws to sign them.\n\nAnd I am grateful to the people's deputies of Ukraine for the fact that the majority of votes collected more than 340 votes in favor. This demonstrates the political unity of Ukraine. Finally.\n\nWhen all parties and groups work together in a legitimately elected parliament, one of the main myths of the invaders that the Ukrainian government allegedly does not represent the will of the people is shattered. It definitely does!\n\nAnd all the collaborators who decided to work a little for the invaders must already think where in Rostov they will hide from punishment.\n\nI hope that on Wednesday the long-awaited rescue of people from the city of Izyum, Kharkiv region, will take place. The humanitarian corridor has been agreed upon.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, 28,893 Ukrainians were rescued from combat areas in Sumy, Kharkiv and Donetsk regions.\n\n20,000 of them managed to leave Mariupol. So far only by personal vehicles. There will be a difficult situation. We are fighting for you. Sorry, everything is very difficult.\n\nThe Ukrainian humanitarian convoy is still constantly blocked by Russian soldiers on the way to the city. But we will not give up trying to save people, to save the city. And I am grateful to each of our defenders! To every defender of Mariupol, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Mykolaiv and all other cities this evil wants to capture.\n\nI am grateful to all who hold on and fight for life.\n\nYour resistance, your resilience, your courage make it possible for Ukraine to survive. And save our people and our land.\n\nI signed a decree on awarding state awards to 139 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who distinguished themselves in the defense of our state. 32 of them - posthumously.\n\nI also signed a decree on conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine with the Order of the Golden Star to:\n\n* **Colonel Hudz Valeriy Fedorovych**. Posthumously. For the heroic defense of Popasna in the Luhansk region.\n* **Colonel Kotenko Serhiy Leonidovych**. Posthumously. Thanks to his courageous actions and personal determination, several columns of enemy equipment were destroyed.\n* **Colonel Maryniak Oleksandr Myroslavovych**. Posthumously. Due to his determination, a large number of enemy soldiers, groups of fuel tanks and enemy equipment were destroyed during the defense of the Kyiv region.\n* **Major Sbytov Pavlo Olehovych**. Posthumously. Thanks to his professionalism and decisive actions, the destruction of several large enemy units was organized.\n\nMay the memory of everyone who died for our Ukraine live forever!\n\nOn conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine with the Order of the Golden Star to:\n\n* **Senior Lieutenant Dozirchy Dmytro Leonidovych**. His effective actions in the defense of the Kherson region allowed our forces to get out of the encirclement and continue the struggle.\n* **Senior Lieutenant Sydunets Volodymyr Volodymyrovych**. Thanks to his actions, the division of the Russian Iskanders was destroyed.\n\n**Glory to all of you!**\n\n**Glory to all our heroes!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"We all want peace.

Dear Justin!**\n\n**Members of the government and parliament!**\n\n**Dear attendees, Dear friends!**\n\nBefore I begin, I want you to understand my feelings, the feelings of Ukrainians. As much as possible. Feelings during these 20 days. 20 days of full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation after eight years of war in Donbas.\n\nJust imagine... Imagine that at four in the morning each of you hears explosions. Terrible explosions. Justin, imagine that you hear it. And your children hear it. Hear missile strikes at Ottawa airport. At dozens of other places throughout your beautiful country, Canada. Cruise missiles. Even before dawn. And your children hug you and ask: “what happened, dad?” And you are already receiving the first reports on which facilities in your country have been destroyed by missiles of the Russian Federation. And you know how many people have already died and where.\n\nImagine you are looking for words to explain this to children. Explain to them that a large-scale war has begun.\n\nThe war aimed at the destruction of your state, at the conquest of your people. And you know it.\n\nThe second day - and you get a message about the columns of armored vehicles. Thousands, thousands coming to your land. First - small cities, then larger ones. They want to block them all. And they do so.\n\nThey approach Edmonton - imagine - and fire artillery. Fire at residential areas, at people. Schools are being burned down, kindergartens are being blown up. Just as in our cities - in Sumy, in our Okhtyrka. They blockade Vancouver and besiege hundreds of thousands of people who remain in the city. As in our Mariupol. For the second week under fire, without electricity completely, almost without food, definitely without water. In the basements.\n\n**Justin! Dear attendees! Gentlemen!**\n\nImagine hearing the report on the dead every day. Yes, you are the president or the head of government, but you just hear about it, about the dead children. And the death toll is growing. 97 children were killed as of this morning.\n\nThe famous CN Tower in Toronto... How many Russian missiles will be enough to destroy it? Believe me, I do not wish this to all of you...\n\nBut we predict every day how many more missiles can hit our TV towers. And they hit them.\n\nOur Freedom Square in Kharkiv and your Churchill Square in Edmonton. Imagine Russian missiles hitting its heart.\n\nOur Babyn Yar is the burial place of the Holocaust victims... The Russians did not stop before bombing even this land. And what about the National Holocaust Monument in Ottawa? Will it withstand the impact of three or five missiles? It happened to us. Air bombs. A minute ago there were people alive. There was a family that just came there. They were alive. And now... You understand.\n\nAnd then a terrible night... each of these 20, when the Russian militaries fire from tanks at housing estates.\n\nFrom tanks - at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Direct guidance. When the fire started there. Can you imagine that happening to your Bruce Station in Ontario?\n\nAnd what would you feel if you saw your flag in every city where they pass, how your flag in Montreal is removed... Removed to be thrown away and replaced with a Russian one.\n\nI know that you support Ukraine, sincerely, effectively. We are friends with Justin. But I want you to understand me, and to feel it.\n\nFeel what we feel. Feel how we want to live. And how we want to win. Win for life.\n\nI want you to feel what it's like when you call your friends and say: close the sky, stop the shelling. No matter which way, just do it. Stop the bombing. How many more missiles must fall on our cities?\n\nAnd in response you hear that someone does not want to do it ... But they are deeply concerned!\n\nThen give us planes, we tell our partners.\n\nThey answer: Soon. Be patient a little. Everyone is deeply concerned. They just don't want to. And someone is looking for reasons. The main thing is the result.\n\nThey talk about escalation. How can it get worse? They say Ukraine is not in NATO now. Although \"the door is open\". But for whom are these doors and where do they lead, if we are told that we will not be admitted.\n\nWar always shows everything people are capable of. Who is strong. And who is weak. Who is wise. Who does not see the obvious. Who is honest and who is a hypocrite.\n\nAnd we saw it all. And we understood all this. In 20 days and eight years. I'm sure you've seen it all.\n\n**Dear speakers!**\n\n**Mr. Prime Minister!**\n\n**Members of the government. Members of parliament!**\n\n**Dear friends!**\n\nCanada has always been, is and, I am sure, will be a reliable partner in Ukraine. Partner of our land, our people of Ukraine, each of our families.\n\nYou came to our aid as soon as we asked for it. You are giving us the weapons and other support we so desperately need now. You have imposed sanctions against Russia - truly moral. Really substantial. However, we see that the war, unfortunately, continues. That Russian troops are not leaving our territory. You see that our cities: Kharkiv, Mariupol are not as protected as your Edmonton and Vancouver. That Kyiv is under missile strikes. Like Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Ivano-Frankivsk and dozens, dozens of our Ukrainian cities that yesterday were peaceful and quiet.\n\nThat means more needs to be done. Much more! For peace. We all have to do more to stop Russia. To protect Ukraine and protect Europe from this total evil that is destroying everything: memorials, churches, schools, hospitals, neighborhoods and all our businesses.\n\nThey have already killed 97 Ukrainian children!\n\nWe do not ask for much. We ask for justice. We ask for real support that will help us endure and defend our life. Life of the whole world.\n\nCanada is already showing the necessary leadership! It is already the first to do what other countries come to later. But we need more leadership, and we ask for more participation from you.\n\nJustin! All friends of our country Ukraine! All friends of the truth!\n\nYou understand how important it is for us to protect our skies from Russian missiles and planes. You can influence this. It seems so to me.\n\nYou can force even more companies to leave the Russian market. So that there is not a single dollar for the war. If they stay in Russia and sponsor the war, they are not allowed to work in Canada. Let it be so - and it will give us peace.\n\nYou know, perhaps better than many in the world, that this attack by Russia is an attempt to destroy us, to destroy the Ukrainian people. Nothing else. This is their main goal.\n\nThis is a war against the people. Against our people. This is a war to destroy everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainians. Against our future. Against our character. Against our will. Everything that you, Canadians, know very well, feel very well.\n\nSo I ask you: do not stop. Do not stop helping Ukraine. Do not stop in leadership and in efforts to bring peace back to our peaceful land.\n\nI believe, I know you can handle it. I know that with Canada, our anti-war coalition, which we are reinforcing, will definitely yield the result.\n\nI want to address our Ukrainian diaspora, all Ukrainians in Canada.\n\nIt is at this historic moment that we need your effective help. And you must prove with your steps that you are a part of the history of Ukraine, the living history of Ukraine.\n\nRemember this - living. Because we want to live. And we strive for peace.\n\nI thank you for your support. I am thankful to everyone present in this hall of parliament. To every citizen of Canada. I'm grateful to you, Justin. Grateful on behalf of the entire Ukrainian nation.\n\nI am sure that together - and only together - we will defeat all enemies.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n\n**Thank you Canada!**\n    ",description:"Хочу, щоб ви відчували, що це таке, коли телефонуєш друзям і кажеш: закрийте небо, зупиніть обстріли.

The war for the right to live freely on our land.\n\nThe Ukrainian people have never demonstrated such unity they are demonstrating nowadays. Never before have so many millions of people in the history of our independence been united by a common goal.\n\nThis goal is the peace that we will have after our victory as well as the liberation of Ukrainian lands from the Russian invader.\n\nAnd these days, an efficient economy and logistics are becoming one of the vital preconditions for our victory.\n\nWe must shape a solid economic rear that will allow us to provide the army and the country with everything they need: from nutrition and medicines to ammunition and modern weaponry.\n\nObviously, the economic and tax system that existed in peacetime is unable to correspond to the challenges we are facing nowadays.\n\nTherefore, in close cooperation with the President of Ukraine, with the Verkhovna Rada people’s deputies, we have embarked on a complete reformatting of the economic model of Ukraine.\n\nBusiness will get maximum freedom, in particular:\n\n* reduction of taxes;\n* removal of all regulations;\n* facilitated access to finance;\n* liberalized labor relations.\n\nIn synergy with the MPs, we have drafted a revolutionary bill in the tax domain.\n\nThus, at the initiative of the Government during the martial law effect, an opportunity to use the single tax option will be significantly expanded for medium and large businesses.\n\nEnterprises with a turnover of up to UAH 10 billion will have a chance to switch to the payment of a single tax. We remove all other restrictions regarding the number of employees and kinds of activities (except for excisable goods and gambling business).\n\nInstead of VAT and income tax, entrepreneurs will pay only 2% of turnover.\n\nThe draft law also contains a number of other positive innovations.\n\n* Individual entrepreneurs of the I and II groups will pay a single tax on a voluntary basis. If there is an opportunity and understanding of the need to support Ukraine – just pay it.\n* Also, individual entrepreneurs will not pay USC [Unified Social Contribution] for their mobilized employees. The state will do it instead.\n* For the period of martial law, individual entrepreneurs will not pay USC if they do not receive income.\n* Sanctions for violating the ‘PRT law’ [Payment Transaction Recorders] will not be applied until the end of martial law.\n* For the period of starting from February 24, 2022, until the end of the year, taxpayers are exempt from paying for land in areas of active hostilities.\n* VAT will not be paid on goods destroyed during the war as well as handed over for the defense needs.\n* Excise duty on fuel will also be abolished, while the VAT rate on these items will be reduced from 20% to 7%.\n\nWithin a few hours after the entry into force of these laws, the Cabinet of Ministers will adopt all necessary bylaws to ensure the new tax system operating already this week.\n\nThe Government will also adopt a decision today to ban business inspections, except for those related to the safety and health of citizens.\n\nMeanwhile, the requirements for obtaining permits for a significant part of business activities will be abolished.\n\nI would like to appeal to farmers. The Government has already launched additional financial support programs to trigger a spring sowing campaign in Ukraine at the earliest opportunity.\n\nUkrainian agricultural producers can already get loans at 0%, while the state guarantees 80% for the amount of such loans to banks.\n\nThe Government has planned more than UAH 25 billion for these two directions of assistance. These resources will be sufficient to support all small and medium-sized farmers who are planning to start a sowing campaign this year.\n\nAnd one more thing. The business support steps we are talking about today are just the initial steps.\n\nWe prolong our activities. Hold the line. We will definitely win.\n\n**Glory to Ukrainians! Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Never before have so many millions of people in the history of our independence been united by a common goal.

Historical war. Another difficult day, which is still approaching our victory. Approaching peace for Ukraine.\n\nAs before, the enemy is confused. They did not expect such resistance. They believed in their propaganda, which has been lying about us for decades.They still can't recollect themselves. But they have already begun to understand that they will not achieve anything by war.\n\nTheir soldiers know this. Their officers are aware of this. They flee the battlefield. They abandon equipment.\n\nWe take trophies and use them to protect Ukraine. Today, Russian troops are, in fact, one of the suppliers of equipment to our army. They could not imagine such a thing in a nightmare.\n\nAnd I want to tell the Russian soldiers. Those who have already entered our land. And who are just about to be sent to fight against us.\n\nRussian conscripts! Listen to me very carefully. Russian officers! You’ve already understood everything. You will not take anything from Ukraine. You will take lives. There are a lot of you. But your life will also be taken.\n\nBut why should you die? What for? I know that you want to survive. We hear your conversations in the intercepts, we hear what you really think about this senseless war, about this disgrace and about your state. Your conversations with each other. Your calls home to your family. We hear it all. We draw conclusions. We know who you are.\n\nTherefore, I offer you a choice. On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I give you a chance. Chance to survive. If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you the way people are supposed to be treated. As people, decently. In a way you were not treated in your army. And in a way your army does not treat ours. Choose!\n\nOur brave defenders continue to inflict devastating losses on Russian troops.\n\nSoon the number of downed helicopters of Russia will reach hundreds of units. They have already lost 80 warplanes. Hundreds of tanks and thousands of other units of equipment.\n\nIn 19 days, the Russian army has lost more in Ukraine than in two bloody and years-long wars in Chechnya. For what?\n\nI am grateful to those Russians who do not stop trying to convey the truth. To those who fight disinformation and tell the truth, real facts to their friends and loved ones. And personally to the woman who entered the studio of Channel One with a poster against the war. To those who are not afraid to protest. As long as your country has not completely closed itself off from the whole world, turning into a very large North Korea, you must fight. You must not lose your chance.\n\nThe European Union has approved the fourth package of sanctions against Russia. The fourth - and I'm sure not the last.\n\nWe are working with partners on new restrictions that will be applied against the Russian state. Everyone who is responsible for the war. Everyone who is responsible for the destruction of democracy. Everyone who is responsible for repression against people. Everyone will get an answer. The answer of the world. And this is just the beginning.\n\nResponsibility for war crimes of the Russian military is inevitable. Responsibility for a deliberate humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities is inevitable. The whole world sees what is happening in Mariupol. Kharkiv. Chernihiv. Sumy. Okhtyrka. Hostomel. Irpin. In all our cities.\n\nAll our partners are informed of the crimes of the invaders against civilians and local self-government in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. In the temporarily occupied areas. There will be an answer for that. Necessarily. For the disrupted humanitarian corridors. Necessarily.\n\nDuring the day of March 14, 3,806 Ukrainians were evacuated from the cities and towns of the Kyiv and Luhansk regions. \n\nOur convoy with one hundred tons of what is most necessary for Mariupol is still kept in Berdyansk. For three days already. But we will try. We will do everything to ensure that Mariupol residents receive food, water and medicine.\n\nI provided full information about the actions of the invaders on the Ukrainian land in conversations with friends and partners of our state. Every aggressive action of the invaders only pushes the world to new sanctions.\n\nI spoke with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. With President of Poland Andrzej Duda. Prime Minister of Luxembourg Xavier Bettel. We have 100% mutual understanding.\n\nThe conversation with Prime Minister of Israel Bennett was also important. As part of a negotiation effort to end this war as soon as possible. With a fair peace.\n\nOur delegation also worked on this in negotiations with the Russian party. Pretty good, as I was told. But let's see. They will continue tomorrow.\n\nThe Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has agreed on a package of decisions to support our economy.\n\nSo that business works. So that people have jobs. Where security allows. Where people are ready for it.\n\nFirst, we are starting tax reform. Instead of VAT and income tax we give a rate of 2 percent of turnover and simplified accounting. For small businesses - this is the first and second group of sole proprietors - we set a voluntary payment of a single tax. That is, if you can - pay. You can't - no questions asked.\n\nThe second is maximum business deregulation. We cancel all inspections for all businesses. So that everyone works normally. So that the cities come to life. So that life continues wherever there is no hostilities.\n\nThe only condition is that you ensure the normal operation of your business in the framework of Ukrainian law.\n\nThese are just the first two steps of our tax reform. To be continued.\n\nAnd finally.\n\nI have just signed a decree on awarding state awards of Ukraine to 234 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who showed personal courage and heroism in the fight for our land. For our independence. 59 of them posthumously.\n\nMay the memory of everyone who gave life for our state live forever!\n\n**Eternal gratitude to all our heroes!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"As before, the enemy is confused.

Who protects roads and cities. All diplomats - official and informal. Everyone who helps with technology. Who keeps the business. Who supplies the necessary goods, products. Who saves and heals under any circumstances. Who works in transport. Who provides communication and repairs networks... I am grateful to everyone. And I sincerely congratulate you!\n\nEach of the volunteers. Each of the millions working together to win.\n\nThe 19th day of our resistance.\n\nThe Armed Forces of Ukraine are holding on bravely. And creatively. We inflict such losses on the enemy that he no longer knows where else to look for reserves. Where else to look for help.\n\nHelp for himself. Help for the invader.\n\nThis is pathetic.\n\nBut we have no right to relax.\n\nThe Russian state has been preparing for war for decades. They have accumulated significant military resources. For the evil. For the conquest of neighbors. And for the destruction of Ukraine, Europe, as we know it, as we value it.\n\nThat's why we have to hold on. We have to fight. To win. To come to the peace deserved by Ukrainians. Fair peace. With security guarantees for our state. For our people. And to put it on paper. In negotiations. Difficult negotiations.\n\nThe video meeting of the delegations has already started today. It continues. Everyone is waiting for the news. We will definitely report in the evening.\n\nAs long as the state is at war, as long as the people are defending themselves, the economy must be preserved and restored. As much as possible in the current difficult conditions.\n\nLife must appear on the streets of the cities. Where security allows. Where people can provide it. Pharmacies, trade, any business that can work. For the country to live. For the restoration of Ukraine to already begin. And it depends on each of us, on each of us who is able to work.\n\nEconomic suppression of Ukraine is one of the tasks of the war against us. And we have to fight back from that as well. Save our economy. Save our people.\n\nTherefore, the government has received a clear instruction - to return small and medium-sized businesses. Remove any obstacles. Reduce taxes as much as possible, remove all difficulties, absolutely all. So that the system does not press, so that people know that they can work the way they can. Where they can.\n\nA new tax model is needed for the war and for the post-war development. The financial rules also need to be updated. To make people feel that they can be flexible. Feel that all the money and valuables will be saved. And that you shouldn’t be afraid of losing something, because the state guarantees the security of assets and savings.\n\nThe Cabinet of Ministers is already working on how to regulate this. A day or two - and there will be details.\n\nUkrainians!\n\nRussian troops continue to destroy our infrastructure, continue to destroy our cities. Kyiv region, Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Kharkiv, south, Donbas.\n\nBut know - we will rebuild everything. We will restore everything. Every street of every city. Every house, every apartment of every Ukrainian. After the war, I'm sure we can do it quickly. We will direct all our efforts to this. All the help of the world. We are already creating funds for Ukraine to live.\n\nBut now that the invaders are still on our land, we must beat them as best as we can. Drive them away in any way we can. Defend the cities. Defend the villages. Defend every meter of our land. And every part of our heart. Ukrainian heart. Ukrainian soul.\n\nHelp each other! Support each other! Support the defense! And protect the state!\n\n**Together we will definitely win.**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Today we celebrate our purely Ukrainian holiday.

The 18th day of our war for life, for Ukraine, for independence.\n\nThe beginning of this day was black. Russian missiles and air bombs hit our country again. From east to west.\n\n30 missiles for the Lviv region alone. The shelling of the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security killed 35 people and wounded 134 others.\n\nNothing was happening there that could threaten the territory of the Russian Federation. And only 20 kilometers away are NATO borders.\n\nLast year, I made a clear warning to NATO leaders that if there were no tough preventive sanctions against Russia, it would start a war. We were right.\n\nI have been saying for a long time that Nord Stream is a weapon that will hit Europe. Now it\'s obvious.\n\nAnd now I repeat again - if you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory. NATO territory. On the homes of citizens of NATO countries.\n\nAn American journalist was killed in the Kyiv region today. Brent Renaud. His colleague was wounded. It was a deliberate attack by the Russian military.\n\nThey knew what they were doing. But not everyone in the West seems to know what they are doing.\n\nIn the east of our country, the invaders decided to "demilitarize" and "denazify" the Sviatohirsk Lavra of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nAt the time of the attack, only monks and hundreds of refugees were on the territory of the monastery. No military target in or near the monastery. But Russian troops do not stop even before striking at the monastery.\n\nThis fact alone demonstrates that the whole ideology of the Russian state is simply a lie.\n\nToday I visited our guys, our defenders who are recovering from wounds at a military hospital.\n\nWe talked. I presented awards. Orders and medals - for courage, for glory for Ukraine.\n\nAnd I really want my greeting "I wish you good health" to work today as powerfully as our Armed Forces have been holding key frontiers. For 18 days already.\n\nBy the way, the Russian military from Ryazan is being treated in the same hospital. He is in the same ward with our defenders. Gets the same aid. From the same doctors. Despite what this guy was doing. Against us, against Ukraine. But Ukrainian doctors saved him. And this is obvious. Because they are people. Not savages. And we have to go through this war so that we all remain human.\n\nI am grateful to all the doctors and nurses who work in Kyiv and Dnipro, in Vinnytsia and Lviv, in Chernihiv and Donbas, in Kharkiv, in Melitopol, in Mariupol...\n\nEveryone!\n\nMariupol Military Hospital.\n\nPokrovsk Military Mobile Hospital.\n\nChasiv Yar Military Mobile Hospital.\n\nMilitary Medical Clinical Center of the Eastern Region.\n\nCherkaske Military Hospital.\n\nMilitary Medical Clinical Center of the Central Region, Vinnytsia.\n\nMilitary Medical Clinical Center of the Western Region, Lviv.\n\nMilitary Medical Rehabilitation Center, left Irpen, but continues to work.\n\nSincere gratitude!\n\nFrom all of us. From all Ukrainians.\n\nI also visited checkpoints today. I didn\'t want it to be very public.\n\nJust to support our guys. To talk. Courageous men, cheerful guys. Who defend Kyiv and know that WE will win. It is felt.\n\nWe will win due to our unique ability to unite.\n\nWe can always care for our people. Ours in spirit, in heart, in sincerity.\n\nI met an extraordinary person there at the checkpoint who supports our defenders every day and brings them a pot of borscht every day. Really delicious! Truly Ukrainian. Wholeheartedly. And I know that our state has been based on such people for centuries. It is thanks to such people that we will survive any dark days. Because we are together. And we always protect our own people. And our own property. NOT for money. Without coercion. NOT like those who came to us. Just because we are Ukrainians.\n\nImportant international negotiations. Bulgaria, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Romania, Poland, Britain.\n\nWe feel the support of these countries. We feel the support for our army. It is important.\n\nI also spoke with Charles Michel, President of the European Council. About our European perspective, which is becoming a reality.\n\nNow about the negotiations with the Russian Federation.\n\nRepresentatives of our countries’ delegations speak in video format every day. Our delegation has a clear task - to do everything to ensure a meeting of the presidents. The meeting that I am sure people are waiting for.\n\nObviously this is a difficult story. A hard path. But this path is needed. And our goal is for Ukraine to get the necessary result in this struggle, in this negotiation work. Necessary for peace. And for security.\n\nSo that we have guarantees - normal, effective. NOT like the Budapest ones and not like in our sky. So that Ukrainians could say: this is what works. These are the guarantees.\n\nIt is necessary to talk.\n\nMore than ten humanitarian corridors worked. Kyiv region, Luhansk region... 5550 people were saved in one day. In six days - more than 130,000. It is necessary to talk.\n\nAnd this is also due to negotiations. We have to understand that.\n\nUnfortunately, the humanitarian corridor to Mariupol was blocked. Again. We did everything necessary. Ensured "silence". Russian troops disrupted the movement of cargo and buses.\n\nBut we will try again. Until we can help our people. Because they are ours. Our Mariupol. Heroic Mariupol.\n\nUkrainians!\n\nWe are going through the worst ordeal in our history. In our lives. We protect the most precious thing we have. We must hold on. We must fight. And we will win. I know that. I believe in that.\n\n**Glory to you!**\n\n**Glory to our people!**\n\n**Glory to our heroes!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ',description:"We are going through the worst ordeal in our history.
