We are proud of the Ukrainian military, rescuers, volunteers, doctors, railroad workers, power engineers ... All those who continue to work and ensure the functioning of vital areas of the state.\n\nWe are proud of the Ukrainian citizens who, despite the presence of the Russian occupier, go on pro-Ukrainian rallies and speak out against the "Russian World". We are proud of all of you!\n\nRussian occupation forces sustain considerable losses. Hundreds of international companies cease operation in Russia, close production, ban the sale of goods.\n\nAnd while Russia is suffering losses on all fronts, we must quickly transfer to the "Martial Law Economy" - to rebuild the efficient operation of all critical enterprises, mobilize resources, create new logistics.\n\nI appeal to the local authorities of those regions that are now in the home front! You are coping well with the challenge of accommodating evacuees. Now is the time to provide them with work.\n\nBefore the war, we altogether talked a lot about industrial parks. Now your solutions in this direction should be the basis for the deployment of enterprises that will work for the sake of our victory.\n\nI appeal to businesses! And to those who are now engage in vigorous activities. To those who at that time were evacuated to other regions. We also have a request to you. If you are not exposed to any danger, gather your employees and resume production! The state needs your help today more than ever!\n\nI appeal to Ukrainians! The war came as a shock to each of us. Many have lost their homes, jobs and savings. But they remained to defend Ukraine. Today the state will support you. On commission of the President of Ukraine, an updated ePidtrymka program will be launched next week. Under this initiative, every employee, every self-employed person whose job was taken away as a result of the war, will be able to receive UAH 6,500 each.\n\nThe program will function by analogy with vaccination payments - that is, through the Diia application. The Ministry of Digital Transformation will provide details on how to apply for assistance and receive the payment.\n\nIt\'s for now. But in the future, each of you must start working for the benefit of Ukraine and our victory. I am grateful to everyone who in one way or another helped our heroic army, as well as continues to help people who found themselves in difficult conditions of destruction and occupation. Now we must resume production where possible.\n\nWhat, for its part, is the Government doing to ensure a speedy conversion to a war economy?\n\nFirst. Financial support for the functioning of the state. We are negotiating financial assistance with all international organizations and countries. Among the recent decisions - the European Investment Bank will transfer EUR 639 million from other projects to the state budget of Ukraine. We have already endorsed the necessary documents within the Government.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has already issued and held an auction of first military government bonds. The second auction is soon to be conducted. Anyone who is willing to invest in Ukraine, our military, our doctors, critical infrastructure workers can do so by purchasing military government bonds.\n\nMoreover, as I told before, we are engaged in establishing the funds with the resources to be directed to restore Ukraine. The Government has already authorized the responsible ministries to open four accounts with the National Bank, to which funds from individuals, organizations, companies and international financial organizations will be credited.\n\nWe are talking about the Economic Recovery and Transformation Fund, the Affected Business Support Fund for small and mid-size entreprises. About the Destroyed Property and Infrastructure Restoration Fund. Here we are talking about homes, and apartments, and the housing that people have lost. In fact, this fund will also provide such compensation issues. As well as the Debt Management and Redemption Fund.\n\nSecond. Economy under the martial law envisages clear needs planning. The state has already begun to place government orders at enterprises to meet the most critical needs. It\'s not just about weapons. We are talking about food, medicines, fuel and other important goods.\n\nWe must provide Ukraine with everything it needs. The Government has already taken a decision to restrict the export of a number of socially important goods and raw materials for their production. Control over food security is currently one of the priorities of the Ministry of Economy.\n\nHence, let’s get to work!\n\n**Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroic Ukrainian people!**\n    ',description:"We are proud of all those who are fighting for a free Ukraine – Address by the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6k4DdN6wAU"},{id:"OWMLWvz6ejY",name:"The situation regarding the Russian invasion",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Олексій Арестович"],date:"2022-03-06T13:23:56",topics:[],cities:[],text:"The situation regarding the Russian invasion – briefing of the adviser to the head of the President's Office",description:"The situation regarding the Russian invasion – briefing of the adviser to the head of the President's Office",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWMLWvz6ejY"},{id:"Gec3XU1aEU8",name:"Ukraine receives support from partners backed by concrete steps",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"https://youtu.be/Gec3XU1aEU8?t=152",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-06T12:08:54",topics:["Міжнародна допомога","Закрите небо"],cities:["Харків","Чернігів","Суми","Маріуполь","Житомир","Коростень","Овруч","Київ","Одеса"],text:"\n**I wish you victory, Ukrainian people!**\n\nI will start with the words of support I hear from our partners. From our friends. Very important words of support backed by concrete steps.\n\nEvery day and every night I talk to the leaders of many countries, to the leaders of the business community. During all the days of the war, there is almost no hour when Ukraine does not hear what help it will receive.\n\nI talked about it again with President Biden last night. I am grateful to him for his determination. For preparing more new solutions for Ukrainians and Europeans. More new sanctions against aggression!\n\nAnd before that I spoke with American congressmen. More than two hundred representatives of both parties of the Congress. They are very sincere. They are fully interested in really helping us, providing concrete assistance.\n\nThese are conversations that increase our confidence. Because one who is on the side of light will never fall into darkness.\n\nThe world has the power to close our sky from Russian missiles. From Russian combat aircraft, helicopters.\n\nIf anyone still doubts, Ukraine needs planes. In fact, it's simple. When you have the will. To make the sky safe. The sky of Ukraine. The sky of Europe.\n\nI spoke with the Prime Minister of Australia. And I am grateful to Australians for their moral stance on Russian exports. There must be no port where a terrorist state can make money.\n\nThe Prime Ministers of Albania, Bulgaria and Israel. Support for Ukraine.\n\nInspirational conversation with Elon Musk. With a man who creates rockets for the future. Instead of killing with rockets for the sake of the past. We talked about how to win now. About how we will cooperate later. After the victory.\n\nSupport for Ukraine from global business, from the leaders of the most advanced companies is no less important than support from leading countries. When the corporate world stands by you and is not afraid, you have double protection. Triple weaponry. You have a future.\n\nUkrainians!\n\nWe have already gained our future.\n\nBut we are still fighting for our present. It is very important. We are fighting for where the border will be. Between life and slavery.\n\nAnd this is not only our choice.\n\nThe citizens of Russia are making exactly the same choice right now. These days. During these hours.\n\nBetween life and slavery. Today. Tomorrow. In the coming week.\n\nThis is the time when it is still possible to defeat evil without irreparable losses.\n\nWhen for a position they threaten with dismissal or a paddy wagon, not with the Gulag. With material losses but not with execution.\n\nDon't miss this opportunity. Social networks, friends, acquaintances, colleagues and relatives. You must be heard! We, Ukrainians, want peace!\n\nCitizens of Russia! For you, this is a struggle not only for peace in Ukraine! This is a fight for your country. For the best it had. For the freedom that you have seen. For the wealth that you have felt.\n\nIf you keep silent now, then only your poverty will speak for you later. And only repression will answer it.\n\nDo not be silent!\n\nThe Russian servicemen who were taken captive by our defenders started speaking. Hundreds and hundreds of prisoners. Among them are the pilots of the planes that bombed our cities. Our peaceful people. We heard their testimony. We saw the documents. Maps. Plans. Elaborated NOT yesterday.\n\nThis is NOT improvisation. This is war.\n\nThey prepared this invasion exactly this way - cruelly, cynically. Сonsciously violating the rules of war. Therefore, Kharkiv. Therefore, Chernihiv. Therefore, Sumy. Therefore, Mariupol. And many, many other Ukrainian hero cities have faced pure evil. Atrocity.\n\nThis was planned.\n\nBut this will not kill our humanity.\n\nDespite everything, we treat war prisoners under the Geneva Convention. Despite everything, our missiles do not hit Russian civilian facilities in response. Or Belarusian. From where rockets fly to our territory every day. Columns of military equipment. Aviation. Against peaceful people. Against peaceful cities. Zhytomyr, Korosten, Ovruch, suburbs of Kyiv, cities in the south... They are preparing to bomb Odesa.\n\nOdesa!\n\nRussians have always come to Odesa. They have always felt only warmth in Odesa. Only sincerity. And now what? Bombs against Odesa? Artillery against Odesa? Missiles against Odesa?\n\nIt will be a war crime.\n\nIt will be a historical crime.\n\nUkrainians!\n\nWe have been fighting for 11 days. For freedom. For the state.\n\nWe withstood. We already understand how we will rebuild our country.\n\nWe are already forming special funds for reconstruction. There are already four of them.\n\nFund for the Restoration of Destroyed Property and Infrastructure. Fund for Economic Recovery and Transformation. Public Debt Service and Repayment Fund. Small and Medium Business Support Fund.\n\nAnd many more programs to support our people. Heroes who fight for our state.\n\nAnd this is just the beginning.\n\nAnd now we still need strength.\n\nWisdom.\n\nWill.\n\nVictory.\n\nPeace!\n\nPeace to save Ukraine.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"«We have been fighting for 11 days.

At the maximum of possibilities. Every soldier on the lines of defense. Every doctor who saves lives. Every firefighter who extinguishes fire. Every entrepreneur who continues to work. Dozens and dozens of other professions. Millions of people, which became one whole. Superpower of the spirit.\n\nProgrammers who joined the information troops. Everyone who joined the territorial defense. Teachers and educators who do not leave children. Police officers. Civil servants. We all withstood the blow together. We will all rebuild our state together.\n\nWhat gives us this confidence? Where is it from? It's not just words. It's not just faith. This is our reality. Unconditional reality. Which is fueled by the energy of our people everyday. Our resistance. Our protest.\n\nKherson. Melitopol. Berdyansk. Konotop. The reality of all cities and towns, rural communities that expel the invaders everyday. By their determination. By their unity.\n\nFreedom Square in Kherson is the whole of Ukraine. The streets of Konotop, where locals are shouting at the invaders, are Ukraine.\n\nUkraine, which we know, love, protect and will not give up to any enemy.\n\nIt is a special heroism to protest when your city is occupied. Even temporarily. When you don't have a weapon and in response you receive gunshots. And you don't run. When you don't have armor and an armored personnel carrier is coming at you. And you do not move aside.\n\nThat is why the occupation is temporary! It is artificial.\n\nOur people, our Ukrainians do not retreat. Do not give up. Do not stop the resistance. They shout to the occupiers - go home. Like a Russian ship!\n\nThey drive them away from our territory. They block the roads for them. Every meter of our Ukrainian land won by protest and humiliation of the invaders is a step forward, a step towards victory for our entire state. This is a chance to live.\n\nUkrainians! In all our cities where the enemy entered. Feel it. Go on the offensive! You need to go outside! You have to fight! Every time when there is an opportunity. As in Kherson. As in Berdyansk. As in Melitopol. As in Konotop. You need to go out and drive this evil out of our cities. To prevent the creation of new DPR and LPR where normal life is simply impossible. Only slavery. Only on the knees.\n\nDonbas! Remember what they said about you: Nobody put Donbas on its knees! And no one will be able to do that! Everyone in Donetsk and Luhansk knows these words. They were often repeated. Earlier. What about today?\n\nDonbas, today is the time! We appeal to all people in the temporarily occupied territory. To all who hear us. Whose memory has not been erased by propaganda. Whose eyes have not been closed by fear. Whose soul has not been mutilated by cynicism.\n\nFight for your rights! For your freedom. For Ukraine. Together with Kherson. Together with Berdyansk. Together with Kyiv and all other Ukrainian cities that value life and are not afraid of anything.\n\nI know that many of you believed that Ukraine allegedly hates you.\n\nWill allegedly attack you. Will allegedly destroy you.\n\nLiars on Russian TV talk about it every day.\n\nLiars. It's their job to lie to you every day. But this should not be your destiny.\n\nJust compare Donetsk after 8 years of war and Kharkiv after 8 days of war.\n\nYou were told that we are destroying cities. Look at Kharkiv. At Chernihiv. At 500 kg bombs that were dropped on the houses of Ukrainians. They were killing us. They were killing children. Look at Borodyanka. Look at the destroyed schools. At the blown up kindergartens. At the damaged Kharkiv Assumption Cathedral. Look what Russia has done.\n\nIt did it right in front of your eyes. Protect yourself! Otherwise, it will take your life, too. Your houses. Ukraine does not shoot its people. We do not blow up residential buildings. And everyone in Donbas has always been and will be our people. Our citizens.\n\nIn Donetsk. Luhansk. Kherson. Berdyansk. Melitopol. Konotop. In all our cities. In all cities of our state. In Ukraine.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:'"Our people, our Ukrainians are not retreating. Do not give up.

Sincere faith. And round-the-clock work.\n\nThe tenth day is like one infinitely long day. One infinitely long night that does not allow us to have a rest.\n\nToday is Saturday. Saturday. This word means nothing during the war. Like Monday or Thursday or any other day. They all became the same.\n\nWe still protect the state. We still save people.\n\nThe country does not know weekends anymore. It doesn't matter what time it is. It doesn't matter what date it is. And it will be so until victory.\n\nLate at night I spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron. And with President of Poland Andrzej Duda. Our interaction is constant. Our conversations are daily. I am immensely grateful to each of them. I am immensely grateful to Andrzej for his determination and devotion to our common cause. Protection of people. I am grateful to Andrzej's wife - Agata. They are friends whom I sincerely consider friends and sincerely wish to everyone.\n\nWe managed to prevent a humanitarian crisis at the border. We managed to organize the situation so that thousands and thousands of Ukrainian women and children were treated decently. Nobody asks about their nationality, faith or how much money they have. In fact, we no longer have a border with Poland. Because we are together on the side of good. We do not have time for borders.\n\nI am sure that soon we will be able to tell our people: come back!\n\nCome back from Poland, Romania, Slovakia and all other countries.\n\nCome back, because there is no more threat.\n\nWe are already thinking about the future. For all Ukrainians. After the war. About how to revive our cities. How to revive the economy. I spoke with World Bank President David Malpass, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.\n\nWe have an agreement among the largest financial institutions to support Ukraine. There is already a decision on emergency aid and tens of billions of dollars for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war.\n\nAnd these are only the first decisions. I emphasize these are only the first. I spoke with Turkish President Erdoğan. I spoke with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. I spoke with President of the European Council Charles Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. The main topic is EU membership for Ukraine.\n\nI am grateful to Europeans - hundreds of thousands of people in different cities of our continent. Bratislava, Vilnius, Frankfurt, Lyon, Paris, Tbilisi, Prague. They came out yesterday in support of Ukraine. In support of Europe. They came out for peace to be reached as soon as possible.\n\nI am grateful to Americans for the unwavering bipartisan majority of ordinary people. We saw the poll. We saw the opinion of ordinary people in America who support ordinary people in Ukraine. Who demand tougher sanctions against Russia for aggression already now. Who support closing the sky now to save the lives of our people. 74 percent of Americans stand for the no-fly zone. 74! The vast majority. What else is needed to make a decision? We are sure that the result is similar in other democratic countries.\n\nThe Armed Forces of Ukraine bravely hold all key areas of our defense.\n\nThey are counterattacking the invaders near Kharkiv - defending the city. They are holding the line in Mykolaiv. Kyiv, Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Donbas. We inflict losses on the invaders they have not seen in their worst dreams.\n\nThe Russian army has not reached the planned frontiers. Yet it has reached almost 10 thousand Russian soldiers killed. 10 thousand. This is dreadful! 18-year-old, 20-year-old boys. Very young, almost children. Soldiers who were not even explained why they were going to fight. For what and why they are in a foreign land. \n\n10 thousand. Russia could definitely give these people something else. Instead of death.\n\nThe Ukrainian people are resisting even where the invaders managed to pass. Unfortunately. But not for long. I admire every Ukrainian who is not silent. Who protests. Who takes the national flag and shows the Russian military that they will lose. They will definitely lose. Because it is impossible to win against people who stop military equipment without weapons in their hands. Who refuse to take anything from the hands of the invaders. Whose situation is tough and dangerous. But they do not lose their dignity. And will never lose it.\n\nAt the talks in Belarus, the groups agreed on the first step. To bring back at least one percent of humanity from the normal level. Surrounded cities that are being destroyed and experiencing the worst days. Humanitarian corridors must work today. Mariupol and Volnovakha. To save people. Women, children, the elderly. To give food and medicine to those who remain. Our help is already on the way. Everyone who needs help should be able to leave. Those who are willing. Everyone who can defend their city must continue to fight. Must. Because if everyone leaves, then whose city will it be?\n\nWe are doing everything - on our part - to make the agreement work. This is one of the main tasks for today. Let's see if we can go further. In the negotiation process.\n\nLet’s pray for our military. Let’s help our civilians.\n\nLet’s work for peace.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"«I am sure that soon we will be able to tell our people: come back!

The President of Ukraine urgently addressed the leaders of the G7 countries. I made an urgent call to the IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi and told that in the agony of fear, the enemy could cause the largest tragedy since the Chornobyl NPP accident.\n\nRadiation knows no boundaries. The possible area coverage is the whole world. Once again, I call on the international community, represented by the IAEA and the EU, to ensure the arrival of peacekeeping groups consisting of representatives of the EU, IAEA and SNRIU (State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine) at all five nuclear power plants in Ukraine. This is a matter of security for the whole world!\n\nThe UN Human Rights Council has taken a critical decision to set up a commission of inquiry to investigate Russia's crimes against Ukraine's civilian population. The more so the work of the International Criminal Court to investigate war crimes committed by Russian terrorist forces in Ukraine commences as well. This means that all those responsible for the deaths, especially of civilians, will be held accountable.\n\nNow I want to appeal to all Ukrainians!\n\nOur total resistance to the enemy must take place on all fronts. On the front lines, on the home front, in the territories temporarily occupied by the enemy. It is time for everyone to get a grip and think with calm mind where he or she can be most effective.\n\nIf you have the experience and desire - join the ranks of territorial defense. Help volunteers. Join the information attack on the enemy. Work at your company. Support each other. Find your place and make your contribution. The 40 million people united by the common idea of victory are impossible to stop and, most importantly, impossible to conquer.\n\nThe Government works 24/7.\n\nToday we have two main objectives. First – to satisfy of the needs of the AFU and other armed formations.\n\nSecond is the provision of the civilian population with essential goods even in those regions, that were now blocked through the hostilities or occupation, the organization of green corridors for the evacuation of the civilian population, the humanitarian assistance deliveries.\n\nYesterday I had a talk with the President of the Red Cross Peter Maurer. He assured me that the Red Cross would do everything possible to help evacuate Ukrainians, deliver food and medicine to places where hostilities are underway.\n\nToday, Ukrzaliznytsia has become a company that purchases food, fuel, medicine for the needs of the state and people affected by the war at the expense of state funds. By the recent decision of the Government, we have allocated UAH 18 billion for these purposes. Let me take this opportunity and thank the railway workers who, despite the risks, continue to perform their jobs and save people!\n\nUkrainians!

They also confirmed that Russia wants to continue the offensive. As best it can.\n\nFor 9 days we have seen a brutal war. They are destroying our cities. They are shelling our people, our children, and residential neighborhoods. Churches. Schools. They destroy everything that ensures a normal life. And they want to continue it.\n\nKnowing that new strikes and casualties are inevitable, NATO deliberately decided NOT to close the sky over Ukraine.\n\nWe believe that NATO countries themselves have created a narrative that the closure of the sky over Ukraine would provoke Russia's direct aggression against NATO.\n\nThis is self-hypnosis. Of those who are weak, underconfident. Internally. Although they may have weapons many times more powerful than ours.\n\nYou had to think about people. About humanity itself.\n\nAnd what did you think about at that summit?\n\nAll the people who will die starting from this day will also die because of you.\n\nBecause of your weakness. Because of your disunity.\n\nAll the Alliance has managed to do so far is to carry fifty tons of diesel fuel for Ukraine through its procurement system. Probably so that we can burn the Budapest Memorandum. To make it burn better.\n\nBut it is already burnt for us. In the fire of Russian troops.\n\nIs this NATO we wanted? Is this the Alliance you were building?\n\nToday, the Alliance's leadership gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities by refusing to make a no-fly zone.\n\nYou could close our sky. But…\n\nI do not know who you can protect and whether you can protect NATO countries.\n\nYou will not be able to buy us off with liters of fuel for liters of our blood. Shed for our common Europe. For our common freedom. For our common future.\n\nBut I am also grateful to our country's friends in NATO. There are many countries of our friends, our partners - most of the powerful partners. Those who help our state no matter what. From the first day of the invasion. And I'm sure, until the victory.\n\nAnd that's why we do NOT feel alone.\n\nWe continue to fight. We will protect our state. We will liberate our land.\n\nThanks to our heroes.\n\nI awarded decorations and medals to 76 Ukrainian heroes for personal courage and selfless actions for our defense. Unfortunately, 37 of them are awarded posthumously.\n\nI awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine to Lieutenant General Oleksandr Oleksiyovych Pavliuk, Commander of the Joint Forces Operation.\n\nI conferred the military rank of Brigadier General on Colonel Volodymyr Vasyliovych Shvorak, Deputy Commander of the East Operational Command of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nI conferred the military rank of Brigadier General of Justice on Colonel of Justice Serhiy Mykolayovych Melnyk, Head of the Military Law Institute of the Yaroslav the Wise National Law University.\n\nI conferred the military rank of Brigadier General on Colonel Artem Yevhenovych Bohomolov, Deputy Commander of the West Operational Command.\n\nI conferred the military rank of General on Valerii Fedorovych Zaluzhnyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"We responded to the invasion as we can in times of greatest danger.

History of Ukraine. History of Europe.\n\nRussian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The largest in Europe. It alone could be like six Chornobyls. Russian tankers knew what they were firing at. Direct aiming at the station. This is terror of an unprecedented level.\n\nThere are 15 nuclear units in Ukraine. And the Russian servicemen have completely forgotten about Chornobyl. About this world tragedy.\n\nRussian people, I want to address you. How is that even possible? Together in 1986 we struggled with the consequences of the Chornobyl disaster. You must remember the burning graphite scattered by the explosion. Victims. You must remember the glow above the destroyed power unit. You must remember the evacuation from Pripyat and the 30 km zone. How could you forget it? And if you have not forgotten, then you cannot be silent. You must tell your authorities, go to the streets and say that you want to live. To live on earth without radioactive contamination. Radiation does not know where the border of Russia is.\n\nAll night I was in touch with partners, with the leaders of other countries, so that the world could react. I felt that the world leaders were shocked. Britain is convening a UN Security Council over the attack. The IAEA is launching its 24-Hour Incident and Emergency Center. Immediate sanctions against the nuclear terrorist state are needed. Immediate closure of the sky over Ukraine is needed, because only this can guarantee that Russia will not strike at least missiles and air bombs at nuclear facilities.\n\nI am grateful to our heroes from the National Guard who guarded the station and tried to stop the enemy. I am grateful to the rescuers who extinguished the fire. But a lot depends on the common people of Energodar. You understand the threat to the station better than anyone else. You live there. Next to it. And you see the invaders directly. Drive them away. Let them know that Energodar is Ukraine. That Ukraine is not a place for nuclear ashes.\n\nUkrainians! The enemy has brought the vast majority of its troops into the territory of our state. Almost the entire Russian army is thrown against our people. But the heroic resistance of Ukrainians has been saving our country from this invasion for the ninth day. Ukrainian cities have not seen such inhuman cruelty since the Nazi occupation. Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Kharkiv, Mariupol. They are purposefully destroying civilian infrastructure. Destroying people. Residential neighborhoods. Just yesterday, Russian bombs killed 47 people in Chernihiv. Peaceful people. Kharkiv... Kharkiv is simply being destroyed by rocket artillery and air strikes. Russia. Destroys. Kharkiv. How could this happen? This morning in Zhytomyr, the rocket hit the school building. Hit children. This is the reality when “fraternal” Russia comes.\n\nYesterday, during talks in Belarus, we managed to agree on the creation of humanitarian corridors where people suffer the most. Today we will see whether the agreement works.\n\nOur defense inflicts maximum losses on the enemy. Almost 9,200 invaders were killed. As of the morning of the ninth day of the war. We beat them near Mykolaiv. We beat them near Kharkiv. We beat them near Kyiv. The capital remains a key target for the invaders. But they will not break us, they will not break our statehood. Never. No matter what they do, they will still lose. Because we are at home. We are on our own land.\n\nThey are constantly preparing provocations. A provocation is being prepared in Kherson. They are going to put up a performance of a kind of rally for Russia. To do this, they brought strangers to the city. They are looking for local traitors. They want to make a TV picture as if Kherson is no longer Ukrainian. I want to remind you that this is how they started the so-called "DPR" and "LPR". You understand what happened to them later. This must be stopped. Kherson residents, show that this is your city. You can stop everything, any plan of the invaders. Do not listen to anyone - listen to your children, listen to your heart. You are Ukrainians.\n\nI urge Kherson residents to get rid of any despair. Ukraine will not give up what is ours. We are fighting against a powerful enemy that outnumbers us. Which outnumbers us in the amount of equipment. But which is thousands of light years away from normal people who have dignity. Show it. Our national flag. Our national anthem. Our national spirit. Be sure to let the occupiers know that they can only be in Kherson temporarily. And they will never be able to own Kherson. Like any other city in Ukraine. Let the occupiers know that they can only stay in Kherson temporarily. And they will never be able to own your city, Kherson. Like any other Ukrainian city - the city of our state.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ',description:"«We have survived the night that could have stopped the history of Ukraine and Europe» address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyi",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKFyL9a3a5k"},{id:"95GZrpeeJmk",name:"Address by the President on regarding the shelling of the Energodar nuclear power plant",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-04T04:13:08",topics:["Атомна станція","Енергодар","Атомна загроза"],cities:["Чорнобиль","Запоріжжя"],text:"Address by the President on regarding the shelling of the Energodar nuclear power plant",description:"Address by the President on regarding the shelling of the Energodar nuclear power plant",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95GZrpeeJmk"},{id:"iGszxUWo_6A",name:"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi spoke with Western media",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-03T20:24:28",topics:[],cities:[],text:"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi spoke with Western media",description:"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi spoke with Western media",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGszxUWo_6A"},{id:"Okq2WNVfS_Y",name:"Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyi",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-03T10:56:28",topics:[],cities:[],text:"«They wanted to destroy us so many times.

The enemy's blitzkrieg failed.\n\nNo major regional cities have ever surrendered without a fight.\n\nNo one is giving a hospitable welcome to the invaders.\n\nUkraine is turning to total resistance. In cities, towns and villages, people are blocking columns of armour and vehicles, attacking supply trucks, and capturing Russian soldiers.\n\nThe information wave produced by Ukrainians has proliferated worldwide. And the whole world is on our side.\n\nWe can feel the support not just in words.\n\nThousands of volunteers from all over the world come to Ukraine to fight on the side of freedom.\n\nWe have already received tons of modern weapons from our partners.\n\nThe UN General Assembly unequivocally acknowledged that Russia had committed aggression against Ukraine and demanded that Russia ceases fire.\n\nThe world is helping us financially. Today, the Memorandum on EUR 1.2 billion macro-financial assistance from the European Union was signed. An agreement on the establishment of a multi-donor fund with the participation in particular of the World Bank to the tune of USD 1.8 billion will be signed in the coming hours. \n\nUkraine has also appealed to the international organizations, in particular the IAEA to immediately call on NATO to close access to the airspace over our nuclear facilities. Close the sky over Ukraine! Now it's a matter of security for the whole world! Not only for Ukraine!!!\n\nWe also appeal to the UN and the Red Cross.\n\nAfter the strikes on civilians, the whole world has seen that Russian troops are terrorists who are killing civilians and do not let anyone help the victims. In some cities, children, pregnant women, and the elderly are trapped by the enemy and have been living without electricity, heat, water, food, and medical care for days now. The invaders do not give safe routes for evacuation. Ukraine demands for the sake of people's lives and health to provide the ‘green corridors’ for us to provide assistance and evacuate everyone who either wishes or needs that!\n\nDespite the full-scale aggression by Russia, the entire life-supporting infrastructure of the state is working sustainably.\n\nAnd so is the Government.\n\nDespite the war, the Government, the Ministry of Social Policy, and the Pension Fund accrued all pensions with 14% adjustment in favour of all Ukrainians. Pensions have been accrued to 13 million people, and the funds have already been transferred to banks. Payments have already been started on schedule, and, for some categories, payments have been made even sooner.\n\nAlso, pursuant to the President's instruction, the Government has developed an assistance program for all Ukrainians who have lost their employment. Every employee, every self-employed person, every citizen of Ukraine who has lost his or her job due to the war and hostilities will unconditionally receive UAH 6’500 each during March. We will announce shortly how this money can be obtained.\n\nFollowing the Government decision, the Ukrainian Railways have started procuring fuel, medications, electricity and other important goods and services. The company will maintain close contact with the civil-military administrations to promptly cover the urgent needs of the people and the state.\n\nMost importantly, the truth is on our side, and we will never give up! Therefore, already now, in follow-up of the instruction of the President of Ukraine, the Government is now establishing 4 major funds. The financial resources from these funds will be spent to rebuild Ukraine.\n\nFirst – This will be the Destroyed Property and Infrastructure Restoration Fund. We will rebuild everything that has been destroyed by the Russian occupationists – every house, every apartment, every school, every kindergarden and hospital! Every bridge, and road!\n\nSecond – Economic Recovery and Transformation Fund. We will ask our partners to accept the so-called ‘Marshall Plan for Ukraine’. We need not just to rebuild the economy, but we will build a new European country.\n\nThird – Debt Management and Redemption Fund. Today, despite the war, Ukraine continuously fulfils all its commitments. On March 1, our Ministry of Finance made a coupon payment of USD 292 million on Eurobonds. But we believe that the world must help and support Ukraine given the heavy burden on us today.\n\nAnd fourth – Affected Business Support Fund. We all see how many entrepreneurs and companies help our military, doctors, and ordinary Ukrainians today. We are all united for a common goal – to chase off the enemy from our land. And we understand that our task is to help entrepreneurs return to normal business, normal life.\n\nWe are here, we are on our land, and no one will be able to take away our European future! We will rebuilt everything!\n\n**Glory to the Ukrainian Army! Glory to the Ukrainian People!

Strong and kind! But – kind NOT to enemies.\n\nWe are a nation that broke the enemy's plans in a week. Plans that have been built for years. Treacherously. Deliberately. With hatred of our country, of our people - of any people who have heart and freedom. But we stopped them. We beat them. Our military, border guards, territorial defense. Even ordinary farmers capture the Russian military on a daily basis. And they all say one thing: they don't know why they're here. Despite the fact that their quantity is ten times bigger, the morale of the enemy is deteriorating. More and more invaders are fleeing back to Russia. From us. From you. From all who drive out the enemy with javelins, stugnas, guns, tanks, planes, helicopters. Everything that shoots.\n\nBut Ukrainians are beating the enemy even without weapons. I sincerely admire the heroic civilians of Konotop, Bashtanka, Energodar, Melitopol. Other towns and villages. Who do not let the invaders in by blocking the roads. People come out in front of enemy vehicles. This is extremely dangerous. But this is brave. It is also salvation. I'm sure you saw a video from Melitopol where Ukrainians protested against Russians who entered our city. Temporarily. I am sure of this: if they entered somewhere, it is only temporarily. We’ll drive them out. With shame. As those people, ordinary people who drive the invaders out of grocery stores when the Russian soldiers are trying to find food do. These are not warriors of the superpower. These are confused children who were used. Take them home.\n\nUkrainians! Every invader should know: they will not get anything here. No one will be conquered. Even if they can accumulate more equipment and more people, it doesn't change anything for them. Wherever they enter. They will be destroyed everywhere. They will not have peace. They will have no food. They will not have a single quiet moment. The invaders will receive only a rebuff from Ukrainians. Fierce rebuff. Such a rebuff that they will forever remember that we will not give up what’s ours. That they will remember what the patriotic war is. Yes, for us it is a patriotic war. We remember how patriotic wars begin. And we know how they end. For the invaders.\n\nOur army is doing everything to break the enemy completely. Almost nine thousand Russians were killed! In one week! In the Mykolaiv direction invaders have to take away the \"two hundred\" and \"three hundred\" with tens of helicopters. 19 years, 20 years ... What did they see in life, apart from this invasion? But most of them remain everywhere. Ukraine does not want to be covered with military corpses. Go home. Your whole army. Tell your commanders that you want to live. Not to die. To live. The war must be stopped and peace restored as soon as possible.\n\nToday was, as usual, an active day of negotiations with the leaders of the member states of our anti-war coalition. I held talks with the heads of government of Norway and Israel. With the President of Kazakhstan. With the Emir of Qatar **Tamim Bin Hamad al Thani**. With President of the European Council **Charles Michel**. With Prime Minister of Canada **Justin Trudeau**. With President of Poland *Andrzej Duda**. Brilliant result at the UN General Assembly. 141 countries supported the resolution, which calls on Russia to withdraw troops from Ukraine immediately. 141 states stand for us! And for Russia - only four states that voted against. Here is the list: North Korea, Eritrea, Syria and Belarus. This is the list. These are the friends. And there will be no others for the state that does not know how to live in peace.\n\nToday I held a meeting with the heads of regions and cities of Ukraine. The new head of the Odesa regional state administration is already working. Maksym Marchenko. Military. Professional. Our guys on the ground are working hard to organize \"green corridors\". To take out civilians. To bring medicine. Volnovakha, cities of the Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv regions, south of Ukraine. This is very difficult. Extremely difficult. We are opposed by terror. But terror loses. Thanks to our heroes.\n\nToday I signed a decree awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to fifteen of our defenders:\n\n**Senior Lieutenant Maksym Vitaliyovych Bilokon**. Posthumously. He took part in repelling the enemy's attack during the defense of Chernihiv, destroyed the enemy's subversive group and two enemy tanks.\n\n**Lieutenant Colonel Oleksandr Valeriyovych Kapichun**. Posthumously. Thanks to his heroic actions, the enemy column was stopped, equipment and enemy soldiers were destroyed.\n\n**Soldier Oleksandr Volodymyrovych Lukyanovych**. Posthumously. During the battle he neutralized up to three dozen units of enemy equipment. He was fatally wounded by an air strike.\n\n**Junior Sergeant Mykhailo Mykhailovych Nesolyony**. Posthumously. He died in close combat with enemy forces while evacuating people.\n\n**Soldier Andriy Valeriyovych Nikonchuk**. Posthumously. He protected the Kyiv HPP from Russian air raids and missile strikes.\n\n**Lieutenant Vitalii Romanoviyh Sapyl**. Posthumously. Tank platoon commander. Neutralized three dozen enemy vehicles. Killed by an air strike.\n\n**Chief Sergeant Oleksiy Oleksandrovych Senyuk**. Posthumously. He defended Chernihiv, destroyed two enemy IFVs and captured a T-72 tank. Killed by an air strike.\n\n**Lieutenant Vladyslav Petrovych Ukrainets**. Posthumously. He covered the retreat of brothers-in-arms when the enemy attacked.\n\n**Major Stepan Ivanovych Choban**. Posthumously. The pilot of the Su-27, distracted the enemy aircraft over Kropyvnytskyi.\n\n**Major Ihor Vasyliovych Mykhalchuk**. Head of the tank battalion unit. Destroyed numerous enemy armored vehicles.\n\n**Colonel Serhiy Mykolayovych Musienko**. Head of the Missile and Artillery Division. Inflicted devastating blows on the enemy in the Kharkiv direction.\n\n**Lieutenant Yevhen Mykhailovych Palchenko**. Tank platoon commander. Covered the exit of the brigade from the encirclement.\n\n**Major Vladyslav Yuriyovych Prokopenko**. Head of the tank battalion. Withdrew personnel and equipment from the encirclement without loss.\n\n**Lieutenant Colonel Pavlo Yuriyovych Fedosenko**. Head of the unit of the 92nd brigade.

I did not accidentally say \"united\". The seventh day of this terrible war began. A war we feel the same way. During this time we have had more unity than for over thirty years before. At first we were equally scared, then we felt equally painful. And now we do not care. Except for victory. Except for the truth. Except for peace. Except for the tranquility we want to achieve. Except for the lives of our people, for whom we are worried. Except for Ukraine. During this time, we have truly become one. We forgave each other a lot. We started loving each other. We help each other. We are worried for each other. Yesterday morning on Freedom Square we were all Kharkiv residents. Then the enemy destroyed us all by striking at residential buildings in Borodyanka. We were all bombed in Kyiv last night. And we all died again in Babyn Yar - from a missile strike. Although the whole world promises constantly - never again.\n\nFor any normal person who knows history, Babyn Yar is a special part of Kyiv. A special part of Europe. A place of prayer. A place of remembrance for the hundred thousand people killed by the Nazis. The place of old Kyiv cemeteries. Who should you be to make it a target for missiles? You are killing Holocaust victims for the second time. During the Soviet era, a TV center was built on the bones there. And also a sports complex. Outbuildings. They built a park there. To erase the true history of Babyn Yar. But why was it bombed? This is beyond humanity. Such a missile strike shows that for many people in Russia, our Kyiv is completely foreign. They know nothing about our capital. About our history. But they have an order to erase our history. Erase our country. Erase us all. On the first day of the war, Uman was brutally bombed, where hundreds of thousands of Jews come every year to pray. Then - Babyn Yar, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were executed. I am now addressing all the Jews of the world - don't you see what is happening? That is why it is very important that millions of Jews around the world do not remain silent right now. Nazism is born in silence. So shout about the killings of civilians. Shout about the killings of Ukrainians.\n\nLast night and tonight they continued to bomb our cities. Bombs. Missiles. Artillery. Machine guns. Targeting peaceful people. Again. Targeting residential areas. Again. Mariupol, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Zhytomyr and other cities and towns of Ukraine. This cannot be explained by any human reason. Any reason of God. What then, if Babyn Yar was attacked? What other military facilities threaten Russia? What other “NATO bases”? Saint Sophia Cathedral? Lavra? St. Andrew's Church? Whatever they dream of there - damn them! Because God is with us!\n\nDuring this time, we have united the European Union already on a new level. Higher than formal. Higher than interstate. At the level of ordinary people. Millions and millions of Europeans. From the Atlantic Ocean to the suburbs of Kharkiv, where fierce fighting continues. When the European Parliament stood and applauded us, our struggle, it was an assessment of our efforts. Our unity. Six days of war like thirty years. That is why the European Union answers \"yes\" to us. We have started a special accelerated accession procedure. Our diplomats and our friends unite the world for the sake of Ukraine and peace even more. Neutral Switzerland has supported EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs, officials, the state and companies. Once again: neutral Switzerland! So what do some other countries expect? Our anti-war coalition has already been joined by the countries that Moscow relied on a week ago. This is an extraordinary result. You can't stay neutral right now!\n\nAnd what is the result for Russia? The flag of this state will no longer be seen in sports tournaments. Modern world culture will now be closed to them. Russian goods are being removed from store shelves around the world. Russian banks are disconnected from the global system. Russian citizens are losing their savings, losing all prospects. Russian mothers are losing their children in a completely foreign country. Think of this number: almost six thousand Russians died. Russian military. In six days of war. This is without counting the losses of the enemy last night. Six thousand. To get what? Get Ukraine? It is impossible. This is not to be changed by missiles. Bombs. Tanks. Any blows. We are on our native land. And for the war against us there will be an International Tribunal for them.\n\nUkrainians! Another night of Russia's full-scale war against us, against the people, has passed. Hard night. Someone spent that night in the subway - in a shelter. Someone spent it in the basement. Someone was luckier and slept at home. Others were sheltered by friends and relatives. We’ve hardly slept for seven nights. Or we sleep, but anxiously. My dears, the time will come when we will be able to sleep. But it will be after the war. After the victory. In a peaceful country, as we need. Which we have always appreciated. And which we have never destroyed. I ask all of you to take care of your loved ones. Take care of your brothers-in-arms. I admire you! The whole world admires you. From Hollywood stars to politicians. Today you, Ukrainians, are a symbol of invincibility.

A cruise missile strike. At the largest square of Europe. Freedom Square. Dozens of victims. This is what the price of freedom is. This is what the morning of the people of Ukraine is.\n\nUkrainian Kharkiv and Russian Belgorod have always been close cities. In many ways. Even the border between them was only conditional, only on maps, but not in the soul. Not in the soul. Now everything has changed. After the cruise missile that struck Kharkiv from Belgorod. The missile that hit Freedom Square. The face of our Kharkiv. This is terror against the city. There was no military target on the square. Just as in those residential areas of Kharkiv hit by rocket artillery. The rocket aimed at the central square is an outright, undisguised terror. No one will forgive. No one will forget.\n\nThis attack on Kharkiv is a war crime. This is state terrorism of the Russian Federation. After that, Russia is a terrorist state. Obviously. And it must be official. We call on all countries of the world to respond immediately and effectively to this criminal tactic of the aggressor and to declare that Russia is committing state terrorism. We demand full responsibility for terrorists in international courts.\n\nKharkiv and Kyiv are currently the most important targets for Russia. Terror is meant to break us. To break our resistance. They are heading to our capital, as well as to Kharkiv. Therefore, the defense of the capital today is the key priority for the state. All cities of Ukraine must do everything to stop the enemy. The military and civilian authorities of each city are responsible for this. But Kyiv is special. If we protect Kyiv, we will protect the state. This is the heart of our country. And it must keep beating. And it will keep beating. So that life triumphs.\n\nDear Kyiv residents! Defense of the capital is above all. That's why I decided to appoint a professional military person as the Head of the Kyiv City Military Administration for the period of war. To guarantee the defense of the city. To block the enemy's approaches to our capital. To ensure that the people of Kyiv have everything they need. The Head of the Military Administration will be General Mykola Mykolayovych Zhyrnov, who served as commander of the support forces. At a high level he organized the engineering support of combat operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2014-2015. He is currently a state expert of the Military Security Service at the National Security and Defense Council. Vitali Klitschko remains mayor of Kyiv. He will have his own sphere of responsibility. And now it is a joint work of the mayor and the Head of the Military Administration. After the war, we will return everything to its place in the capital.\n\nRegarding our diplomats. Right now, our diplomats are implementing fair and absolutely necessary decisions in relation to those states that have betrayed their word and international law. We immediately recall the Ambassador from Kyrgyzstan for consultations. For justifying aggression against Ukraine. We immediately recall the Ambassador from Georgia. For the obstacles to volunteers who want to help us. For an immoral attitude towards sanctions.\n\nAnd now I want to speak about those whose feat is an example of the highest moral strength. These are our doctors. You save people around the clock. Always. And now your work is one of the key lines of our defense. You keep it brilliant. Thousands of lives have been saved in 5 days. I am also grateful to everyone who provides our people with everything they need for life in these extremely difficult conditions. Food, energy, medicine. And I thank the ordinary people of Ukraine, who stop tanks with their bare hands, expel the invaders from administrative buildings by force of spirit and make their stay in Ukraine shameful. To prove that they are all strangers here. This is what the people's war is. This is what the people of Ukraine is.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"The missile at the central square of Kharkiv is terrorism, and Russia must be held accountable for this in international courts - Address by the President of Ukraine.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opcPsPcaPOA"},{id:"ZbrSG0CMXak",name:"Address by the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-02-28T23:40:40",topics:["Ракетний удар","Воєнний злочин","Оборона Києва","Відкликання дипломатів","Приєднання до ЄС"],cities:["Харків","Київ"],text:"\nRussian forces today brutally shelled Kharkiv with rocket artillery. This is definitely a military crime. A peaceful city. Peaceful residential areas. No military object. Dozens of eyewitness records prove that this is not a separate false shot, it is a conscious destruction of people. Russians knew where they were shooting.\n\nFor this crime there will definitely be a tribunal. International. This is a breach of all conventions. No one in the world will forgive you the murder of peaceful Ukrainian people. Here is Ukraine. Here is Europe. Here is 2022. Evil, armed with rockets, bombs and artillery, must be stopped immediately. Destroyed economically. We must show that humanity is able to protect themselves. I believe that it is necessary to consider the full closure of the sky for Russian missiles, airplanes, helicopters. In five days of invasion, already 56 missile strikes have been carried out against Ukraine. 113 cruise missiles were fired. This is their \"fraternal friendship\". And the world knows what to do. I spoke about this with partners today.\n\nThe state committing military crimes against civilians cannot be a member of the UN Security Council. The entrance to all ports, channels, airports in the world must be closed for this state . Such a state must not receive hundreds of billions for energy exports. Buying Russian goods now is to pay money for murdering people.\n\nPeaceful, proud, strong Kharkiv. You have always been such. You will always be such. We will withstand this as well. We will defend Ukraine. We will help everyone affected by inhuman invasion. Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Sumy, Hostomel, Vasylkiv, Kherson, Mariupol, Donetsk and all other cities and towns of our native country will see a peaceful and safe life. Sincere condolences to all who lost their relatives and loved ones in this war. Eternal memory to those who died. Eternal glory to everyone who defends our freedom!\n\nBefore addressing you, I signed a decree on awarding the title of the Hero of Ukraine to twelve our defenders:\n\n* **Lieutenant Colonel Eduard Mykolayovych Vahorovsky** (posthumously). He died saving our aircraft from a missile strike. Gave others the opportunity to take to the air. \n* **Major Dmytro Valeriyovych Kolomiets** (posthumously). He rescued his brothers-in-arms, diverted enemy aircraft fire and was shot down by an enemy plane.\n* **Lieutenant Colonel Hennadiy Vasyliovych Matulyak** (posthumously). Hostomel. Destroyed the group of enemy equipment.\n* **Lieutenant Vitaliy Anatoliyovych Movchan** (posthumously). In an air battle he destroyed two enemy aircraft.\n* **Colonel Oleksandr Yakovych Oksanchenko** (posthumously). He died in an air battle, distracting enemy aircraft.\n* **Senior Lieutenant Vyacheslav Denysovych Radionov** (posthumously). Thanks to his courageous actions, the entire crew of the brigade's planes took to the air in Vasylkiv, and this saved ours from a missile strike.\n* **Senior Lieutenant Andriy Andriyovych Gerus**. Over the city of Kropyvnytskyi he shot down an enemy IL-76, which prevented the landing of Russian troops with weapons.\n* **Brigadier General Dmytro Serhiyovych Krasylnykov**, Commander of the Operational and Tactical Group \"North\". For two days he has been fighting off the continuous assault, saved people and equipment. And did not let the enemy into Kharkiv from the Luhansk region.\n* **Lieutenant Colonel Andriy Mykolayovych Kruhlov**. He withdrew the Buk SAM unit from the enemy attacks and personally destroyed two Russian helicopters and one plane.\n* **Colonel Oleksandr Volodymyrovych Mostov**. He shot down a Russian IL-76 near Vasylkiv, as well as two Mi-24 helicopters, which prevented the landing of paratroopers and weapons.\n* **Lieutenant General Yuri Ivanovych Sodol**. In the battles for Volnovakha, he saved our men from the encirclement and organized a successful counterattack. He brought people out of the enemy’s attack. Defends Mariupol extremely effectively.\n* **Colonel of medical service Eduard Mykolayovych Khoroshun**. He personally organized the defense of the besieged military medical center and carried out the evacuation of the wounded.\n\nNow about Kyiv, our beautiful capital, the basis of our state, our security. For an enemy, Kyiv is the key target. They want to break our national statehood. Therefore, the capital is constantly in danger. Three rocket-bombing strikes are carried out only today. TETs-6 is the target. They want to damage a power station and leave our city without light. We did not allow them to break the defense of the capital. And they send saboteurs to us. Constantly. Hundreds. All they are being neutralized.\n\nIn addition to defense, we are thinking about the rear as well. Provide people with everything necessary. We formed a round-the-clock coordination headquarters that collects all requests from regional administrations regarding the lack of the most necessary stuff. Products, medicines, fuel, equipment. The headquarters directly  finds suppliers that can quickly and qualitatively meet such needs. This is the restoration of supply chains, interrupted by the war.\n\nToday, at the initiative of the Russian side, the first round of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia took place. These negotiations took place against the background of bombing and shelling of our territory, our cities. Synchronization of shelling with a negotiation process could be seen. I believe that Russia is trying to put pressure on us in such a way. Don't waste time. We do not perceive such tactics. Fair negotiations are possible when one side does not hit the other side with rocket artillery precisely at the moment of negotiations.\n\nSo far we do not have the result we would like to get. Russia has declared its position. We have outlined positions in response - to end the war. Some signals we received. When the delegation returns to Kyiv, we will analyze what we’ve heard and then determine how to move to the second round of negotiations.\n\nAnother thing that is very important to say. We've been waiting 30 years for this. Today I signed an application for Ukraine's membership in the European Union. We have gained the right to be together with everyone in Europe. The application has already been delivered to Brussels, officially registered. The time has come.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbrSG0CMXak"},{id:"l5XTh2DSZCE",name:"Briefing of the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denis Shmygal",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Денис Шмигаль"],date:"2022-02-28T19:14:03",topics:["Соціальні виплати"],cities:[],text:"\n**Heroic people of Ukraine!**\n\nIt is the fifth day of our liberation war against the Russian invaders.\n\nThe whole Ukrainian nation stood up for the struggle. While our troops bravely defend the Ukrainian land from the invasion of the occupiers, civilian Ukrainians and the Ukrainian state began to work hard in a mode – ‘all for the frontline, all for victory’\n\nPrivate businesses provide free-of-charge fuel, medications, food, and equipment for the troops. The courage and valour of our military inspire all Ukrainians to contribute as much as they can to our victory. People cook food for the fighters, weave camouflage nets and set up checkpoints.\n\nThe Government also continues to work tirelessly. Today, at an ad-hoc Government meeting, we made the following decisions.\n\nToday, pursuant to the instruction of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Government has decided that, for the time of martial law, all the servicemen will be paid an additional remuneration of UAH 30’000 per month.\n\nAll the servicemen who see action and are direct parties of combat mission or involved in national security and defence operations will be rewarded with an increased monthly remuneration of UAH 100’000.\n\nMoreover, families of the fallen servicemen will be paid a one-time compensation in the amount of UAH 15 million.\n\nThese decisions remain valid since February 24 this year – the day when the Russian Federation brought about a full-scale war against Ukraine.\n\nThe Cabinet of Ministers has also significantly expanded the list of critical imports. It was supplemented by meat and edible offal, milk and dairy products, vegetables, nuts, coffee, tea, cereals, wheat flour, juices, fats and oils, sugar and confectionery. The list also includes a number of defence goods.\n\nA 24/7 Coordination Centre for food, medicine, drinking water and fuel supplies has been set up to provide war-affected municipalities and regions with everything they need.\n\nDuring the martial law period, the Cabinet of Ministers facilitated and simplified the procurement procedures for goods, works and services required for the Ukraine's defence and for ensuring livelihood of the population and functioning of the state. The procurement procedures will be initiated by the leaders of contracting entities or the bodies managing state property assets.\n\nThat is how our nation is hardened.\n\nThe whole world is now talking about Ukraine. People all over the planet gather in streets and squares wearing blue and yellow colours of our flag and shout ‘Glory to Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to heroes! Hands off Ukraine!’.\n\nWe are grateful to our friends all over the world for the assistance they have been providing to Ukraine – defence, humanitarian, and economic.\n\nWe are grateful for the sanctions you are imposing on Russia.\n\nWe are appreciative of the support rallies that are taking place all around the world.\n\nWe are thankful for the closed sky for Russian planes.\n\nAnd more, Ukraine has appealed to the European Union to join immediately under a special procedure. We, all the Ukrainian people, will be grateful for the positive decision!\n\nFellow Ukrainians, keep holding the line! We continue to work as hard as we can for our victory!\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!

The fifth day of Russia's full-scale war against the people of Ukraine. We stand firm. During this time, we have experienced as much as other nations may not have in decades. We have been told for a long time that there is something wrong with Ukrainians in this or that issue. That Ukrainians have to do so-called \"homework\" for decades. Because of this, we often did not notice what we are really capable of. And now we have shown ourselves to the fullest. And it's inspiring. For everyone.\n\nIn every conversation with our partners, I hear sincere respect. Ukrainians have shown the world who we are. And Russia has shown what it has become. Just think about it: during the Russian invasion - in just four days - sixteen Ukrainian children died as a result of the Russian shelling. Sixteen! 45 children were wounded.\n\nEvery crime, every shelling that the invaders commit against us, unites us and our partners even more. Russia did not believe in such a solidary and powerful reaction. But Ukrainians have changed that story. The European Union has decided to supply us with weapons. We are grateful. Yesterday I spoke with Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, about further, even stronger steps. Europeans are aware that our soldiers are fighting for our country and, consequently, for the whole of Europe. For peace for all European countries, for the lives of children, for equality, for democracy. And this gives us the full right to do the following.\n\nWe appeal to the European Union for Ukraine's immediate accession under a new special procedure. We are grateful to our partners for being with us. But our goal is to be with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be equal. I am confident that is fair. I am confident we deserve it. I am confident that all this is possible.\n\nYesterday I spoke with the Presidents of Portugal, Lithuania, President of France Emmanuel Macron and President of Poland Andrzej Duda. I am especially grateful to Andrzej Duda for our fruitful work. I spoke with the Prime Ministers of Belgium, Spain and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. Support of our anti-war coalition is unconditional and unprecedented.\n\nEurope has closed the sky to all Russian planes. Global business refuses any ties with Russian companies. Let's see how this week will end for the Russian currency - what will be the fall of the ruble. As long as this criminal invasion of Ukraine continues, the Russian state is suffering losses as if the war passed through their territory. Do you need all this? Russian mothers, Russian teachers, Russian entrepreneurs, ordinary people. For what?\n\nFour and a half thousand Russian soldiers have already been killed. Why did you all come here? Why do the columns of your armored vehicles go against us? From our Crimea. From Yalta, Yevpatoriya, Sudak, Simferopol... These are not the names of military camps for tankers. Once again: four and a half thousand Russian invaders killed. Throw away your equipment. And leave. Do not believe your commanders. Do not believe your propagandists. Just save your lives. Leave.\n\nWe dedicate every hour to strengthening our state. Anyone who can join the fight against the invaders must do so. Therefore, a decision was made - not easy from a moral point of view, but useful from the point of view of our protection. Under martial law, participants in hostilities - Ukrainians with real combat experience - will be released from custody and will be able to compensate for their guilt in the hottest spots of war. All sanctions are lifted from some people who took part in the anti-terrorist operation. The key now is defense.\n\nWhen I ran for presidency, I said that each of us is the President. Because we are all responsible for our state. For our beautiful Ukraine. And now it turns out that each of us is a warrior. The warrior in his or her own place. And I am confident that each of us will win.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Stand firm: Address by the President of Ukraine",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRwkk2mgfnU"},{id:"dA5f9CXh5bY",name:"Briefing by Oleksii Arestovych, Adviser to the Head of the President's Office",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Олексій Арестович"],date:"2022-02-27T23:49:59",text:"Briefing by Oleksii Arestovych, Adviser to the Head of the President's Office",description:"Briefing by Oleksii Arestovych, Adviser to the Head of the President's Office",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA5f9CXh5bY"},{id:"BeidqIRfLhE",name:"Volodymyr Zelenskyi told about the phone call to Oleksandr Lukashenko",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-02-27T18:45:12",topics:["Перемовини","Білорусь"],cities:[],text:'\nI had a phone conversation with Alexander Lukashenko.

And he assured me of that.\n\nMy task as President is to protect our state. And you have seen during these tough days how we are fulfilling this task.\n\nAlexander Lukashenko called on the meeting of the Ukrainian and Russian delegations on the Pripyat River. I emphasize: without any conditions.\n\nI will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as President, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance.\n\nAnd while our guys are there, the President is here, the Head of the Office is here, the Prime Minister is here, the army is here, the Commander-in-Chief is here. We will all defend our state and our borders.\n\nYou and I must act pragmatically to achieve our goal. And our goal is our territorial integrity. You have seen our position one hundred percent. This is the unconditional protection of national statehood.\n\nAs regards our motivation. It is obvious that our servicemen are fighting not for money, but for today, for tomorrow. And they provide a very tough response to what happened yesterday.\n\nBut we must understand that today the most important job is to be a soldier, to defend the country. And that\'s why I really want the state to pay decently for this job.\n\nWe will pay our armed servicemen a hundred thousand hryvnias a month. Not to hear "thank you" from them, but to let them know that the country is definitely grateful to them. And it will be so until this war is over.\n\nAnd the last thing. Yesterday, unfortunately, we lost our "Mriya". But the old "Mriya".

They are going to kill our children even more insidiously. This is an evil that has come to our land and must be destroyed.\n\nThey lied that they would not touch the civilian population. But since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.\n\nThey consciously chose tactics to destroy people and everything that makes life just normal. Power plants, hospitals, kindergartens, residential buildings - all this is under attack every day.\n\nWhat the invaders are doing to Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, Kyiv, Odesa and other cities and towns deserves an international tribunal. We clearly record all their crimes. And there would have been many more of these crimes if it hadn't been for our courageous defenders.\n\nUkrainian forces are great. Repulse attacks, breaking the enemy's plans. They do their job brilliantly.\n\nYes, this is truly a job. A hard, fundamental, and most importantly - fair job. A job that deserves the highest appraisal and the highest gratitude. A decision was made to significantly increase the payments to our defenders. I can honestly say that it will be expensive. But there is nothing more precious than life and the struggle for our freedom and freedom of our next generations.\n\nAnd there are those who will help us. This is already real. We get weapons, medicine, food, diesel, money. A strong international coalition in support of Ukraine has been formed. An anti-war coalition.\n\nHere is the latest summary from the diplomatic frontline. There were very substantive talks with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the President of Georgia, the Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Johnson. Each conversation added specifics to the defense capabilities of our state and the strength of our military.\n\nGermany has announced the supply of 1,000 anti-tank grenade launchers and 500 Stingers with additional ammunition. Belgium provides 5,000 machine guns and 5 million rounds of ammunition, and another 4,000 tons of fuel.\n\nThanks to active diplomacy, we’ve convinced all European countries to disconnect Russia from SWIFT. We thank President of Poland Andrzej Duda for his personal leadership in granting Ukraine membership in the European Union. Poland's daily assistance to our country is also very much needed.\n\nWe have to call a spade a spade. Russia's criminal actions against Ukraine show signs of genocide. I talked about this with the UN Secretary General. Russia is on the path of evil. The world must deprive Russia of the right to vote in the UN Security Council.\n\nUkrainians!

More shelling. More bombing of residential areas, civilian infrastructure. Today there is not a single object in the country that the invaders would not consider a valid target for themselves. They fight against everyone. They fight against everything that’s alive - against kindergartens, against residential buildings and even against ambulances. They use rocket artillery, missiles against entire urban areas in which there has never been any military infrastructure.\n\nVasylkiv, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and many other cities of Ukraine are surviving in conditions that were last seen on our land and your land during the Second World War.\n\nBut in the war that is going on now, you are not on the same side with us. Regretfully. From your territory, the troops of the Russian Federation launch rockets into Ukraine. Our children are being killed from your territory, our houses are being destroyed, they are trying to blow up everything that has been built over decades - and, by the way, not only by us, but also by our fathers, our grandfathers.\n\nAnd all this is also a de facto referendum for you, Belarusians. You decide who you are. You decide who to be. How will you look into the eyes of your children, how will you look into the eyes of each other, your neighbors. And we are your neighbors.

Exactly today.\n\nNow there is a lot of news about possible negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, which can end this war and restore peace to all of us. And they often mention your capital. Minsk.

The heavy equipment followed. And this is a dreadful deja vu. You know, Kyiv was attacked at 4 am. Someone has such a sense of humor, just as in 1941. You slept, Belarusian brothers. And we woke up. But you are still sleeping. And we haven't gone to bed since that moment. Because we are fighting. We are fighting for our country. We are fighting for our freedom. Because we have every right to do so.\n\nIf there were no aggressive actions from your territory, we could speak in Minsk. In your city. When you were neutral, we spoke in Minsk, we met many times. This is right. This is truthful. To talk like neighbors. Right now, you haven't made your big choice yet. And it is ahead, it should depend only on you. Not on Russia, not on Ukraine, not on America, but on the people of Belarus.\n\nThat is why now we say - not Minsk. The venue for the meeting may be other cities. Of course, we want peace. We want to meet, we want the end of the war! Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, Istanbul, Baku - we proposed to the Russian side all of this. Any other city suits us in a country from whose territory missiles are not launched. Only in this way can negotiations be honest. And they can really end the war.\n\nI sincerely wish Belarus to once again become that kind, safe Belarus that everyone saw not so long ago. Make the right choice. I am sure this is the main choice of your great people.\n    ",description:"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi addressed the citizens of Belarus",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwkFfesUFxY"},{id:"7ZHUyOBpQi4",name:"Briefing of the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denis Shmygal",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Денис Шмигаль"],date:"2022-02-26T21:11:24",topics:["Міжнародна допомога","Дії уряду"],cities:[],text:"\n**Heroic people of Ukraine!**\n\nFor more than 2 days now, our troops have been destroying the occupiers on land, at sea and in the sky. \n\nThousands of Russian soldiers were killed, and hundreds were taken prisoner. \n\nOur army is defending all parts of the frontline. The enemy had expected a cakewalk, but, instead, ended up in a real hell. \n\nUkraine is rising! Tens of thousands of volunteers, reservists and territorial defense fighters have already joined the defense of our land. \n\nThe Russian leadership does not understand that it is at war not only with the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but with the whole Ukrainian nation. And this nation has already risen to the liberation war against the occupiers. \n\nThe enemy has never achieved its goal, and, therefore, began shelling peaceful population and civilian infrastructure. They shoot at kindergartens, hospitals, and households; they shoot down ambulances and buses with children. The Russian command must appear before the tribunal for these crimes!\n\nThe enemy must definitely be punished for killing Ukrainian children! UKRAINE WILL NEVER FORGIVE!\n\nWe stay in Kyiv and continue to work hard. An extraordinary meeting of the Government has taken place today, and a number of important decisions have been made.\n\nFirst! Ensuring sustained operation of food producers under conditions of martial law. The maximum billing time for socially significant domestic food products will be no more than ten calendar days from the invoice date submitted by the suppliers.\n\nSecond! According to the recently passed order, the State Reserve Agency is required to provide sufficient diesel fuel supplies for the needs of the military.\n\nThird! An ordinance on the transfer of property confiscated by a court order and the State Customs Service to the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was adopted.\n\nFourth! We have established the procedure to coordinate humanitarian aid supplies and their further delivery to the Ukrainians. The State Border Guard Service and the State Customs Service shall secure a simplified border-crossing regime for humanitarian aid vehicles. For their part, the civil-military administrations, together with the National Guard, National Police and State Emergency Service, will ensure acceptance, distribution, and warehousing of humanitarian aid. \n\nIt has to be reminded that yesterday we adopted Resolution 5155 ‘On Recognition of Humanitarian Aid as Goods Required for National Security and Defense’. According to this resolution, for the time while martial law is enforced, the territorial defense leadership will have the right to decide on varieties of goods and humanitarian aid required for national security and defense. Such shipments will be allowed to cross the state border of Ukraine immediately.\n\nFifth! We have adopted a resolution on payment and delivery of pensions and cash aid for the period of martial law. Whenever any people find themselves unable to receive the money in their communities, or if it is not possible to wire it to the specified account, the pensions and cash aid will be handled through money orders. The Ministry of Social Policy, together with the Pension Fund and other bodies, will contact the recipients through personal e-accounts of the Pension Fund to actualize their place of residence.\n\nAnd the sixth! The government has decided to temporarily close all the BCPs across the state border of Ukraine with Russia and Belarus. And now, one very important point!!! Citizens of Ukraine who are still in those countries and want to come back home will be able to enter Ukraine. Come back and prove that you stand up for the good!\n\nI want to appeal once again to all civilized countries. It is time to choose your side! Are you on the side of child killers, or you are on the side of a great European nation that protects its freedom and its country from the aggressor? Give Ukraine defense weapons!!! Help us with equipment and materiel! Isolate Russia in all areas where possible! And we will continue to defend our country in the meantime. \n\nWe thank our friends from Poland, Latvia, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, the U.S., the United Kingdom, and other countries who have already sent and continue to send us weapons. The Ukrainian people will never forget this! \n\nMy Fellow Ukrainians, keep holding the line! We are on our land!

We withstood and successfully repel enemy attacks. The fighting continues. In many cities and districts of our state. But we know what we are defending. The country, the land, the future of children.\n\nKyiv and key cities around the capital are controlled by our army. The invaders wanted to block the center of our state and put their puppets here, as in Donetsk. We broke their plan. They did not gain any advantage over us.\n\nOn our streets, in the skies of Kyiv, in Vasylkiv, in Vyshhorod, even in the surrounding fields, a real battle for Kyiv took place. The enemy used everything against us: missiles, fighter aircraft, drones, artillery, armored vehicles, saboteurs, paratroopers. The invaders are shelling residential neighborhoods, including with the use of missile artillery, trying to destroy energy facilities. They have very treacherous tactics.\n\nDwellings destroyed by missiles and artillery are the ultimate argument for the world to stop the occupation invasion together with us.\n\nI say this as frankly as possible now: the people of Ukraine have already earned and have the right to become a member of the European Union. This will be the key evidence of our country's support.\n\nIt is a crucial moment to close the long-standing strategic discussion once and for all and to decide on Ukraine's membership in the European Union. I discussed this today with Charles Michel, Ursula von der Leyen, Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe anti-war coalition is operating - defense weapons and equipment are heading to Ukraine. We already have almost full support from EU countries for disconnecting Russia from SWIFT. I hope that Germany and Hungary will have the courage to support this decision. We have the courage to defend our homeland, to defend Europe.\n\nIn each of our cities, the invaders are being severely rebuffed. Uman, Odesa, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Donbas, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv - wherever the enemy kills our people, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing everything to stop and destroy the invaders. Lviv and other cities in western and central Ukraine that are under air attacks endure firmly. Well done!\n\nEvery Ukrainian needs to remember one thing. If you can stop and destroy the invaders, do it. All those who can return to Ukraine, come back to defend Ukraine. And then we will have a lot of work with you to rebuild it!\n\nAll those who can defend Ukraine abroad, do it purposefully, unitedly, continuously! All friends of Ukraine who want to join the defense - come, we will give you weapons! All the details of how to implement this will be announced in the near future.\n\nGlory to all those who defend Ukraine today! You are heroes!\n\nI adopted a decision to posthumously award the title of Hero of Ukraine to Vitaliy Volodymyrovych Skakun, a sapper of the 35th Separate Marine Brigade. At the cost of his own life, he blew up the bridge.\n\nAnd now I want absolutely everyone in Russia to hear me. Thousands of victims. Hundreds of prisoners who simply cannot understand why they were sent to Ukraine. Sent to be killed. The sooner you tell your government that the war must be stopped immediately, the more of your people will remain alive.\n\nWe see that there are indeed protests by your citizens against the war. We know that many in Russia are now simply shocked by the meanness and cruelty of the authorities. This is a truly correct response. I thank you for this reaction. Thanks to Leonid Parfyonov, Dmitry Muratov, Yury Dud, Liya Akhedzhakova, Valery Meladze and thousands, thousands of other Russians whose conscience is heard loud. Just stop those who lie to you, lie to us, lie to the whole world. We need to end this war. We can live in peace - in global peace, in human peace.\n\nOur military, national guards, national police, territorial defense, border guards, special services, citizens - hold on! We will defeat everyone.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"We withstood: address by the President of Ukraine on the third day of the war",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJRYocGoHWQ"},{id:"wkJjhwKCXiw",name:"Address by Iryna Vereshchuk to the International Committee of the Red Cross",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Ірина Верещук"],date:"2022-02-26T11:13:07",text:"Address by Iryna Vereshchuk to the International Committee of the Red Cross",description:"Address by Iryna Vereshchuk to the International Committee of the Red Cross",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkJjhwKCXiw"},{id:"az2QFR5pJIs",name:"Do not believe the fakes!",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-02-26T08:29:51",topics:["Фейкова інформація"],text:"Do not believe the fakes!",description:"Do not believe the fakes!",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az2QFR5pJIs"},{id:"w9Ej8IzV4fU",name:"The situation regarding the Russian invasion (morning of the third day) - a briefing by Mykhailo Podoliak",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Михайло Подоляк"],date:"2022-02-26T08:18:14",text:"The situation regarding the Russian invasion (morning of the third day) - a briefing by Mykhailo Podoliak",description:"The situation regarding the Russian invasion (morning of the third day) - a briefing by Mykhailo Podoliak",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Ej8IzV4fU"},{id:"p1653ejfNH0",name:"Address by the President of Ukraine in the evening of the second day of the large-scale war",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-02-26T06:58:46",topics:["Міжнародна коаліція","Ракетний удар","Поранені діти"],cities:["Ворзель","Охтирка","Чернігів","Суми","Харків","Київ"],text:'\nToday was a hard yet courageous day. We are fighting for our state absolutely on all frontlines: South, East, North, in many cities of our beautiful country. Fighting around the clock on the diplomatic frontline as well - it\'s easier to say with whom I did not speak to among world leaders today. We continue this. I have been constantly working and spoke with President Macron, Scholz, Rutte, Mrs. von der Leyen, President of the United States Biden. I outlined what answer Ukrainians still expect from the West to this aggression and agreed on new assistance, new support, significant assistance for our state. I thank all the leaders and I am separately grateful to President Biden.\n\nI was really glad to see the news from friendly Georgia. I want to thank the good, beautiful Georgian people who went out on the streets of their country and supported Ukraine. You are true friends! Thanks.\n\nOur main goal is to end this slaughter. The enemy suffers very-very serious losses. These are hundreds, hundreds of killed soldiers who crossed our border, who came to our land.\n\nWe suffer losses as well, unfortunately. Ukrainians resist the aggression heroically. It is impossible to justify. Therefore, the invaders have to come up with more and more absurd accusations to say at least something.\n\nI am convinced that these allegations are biased, nobody will believe them. Ukrainians won’t believe them, the world won’t believe them, citizens of the Russian Federation won’t believe them.\n\nIt\'s simply cannot be such a truth that could clarify why kindergartens and housing infrastructure are fired from a missile artillery. In Vorzel, Kyiv region, they fired "Grads" at an orphanage. Okhtyrka, Sumy region, was shelled by "Uragans". Housing quarters, shelter, kindergartens were under the shelling. What is this war against Ukrainian children in a kindergarten? Who are they? Are they neo-Nazis from kindergarten as well? Or were they NATO soldiers that threatened Russia? Killed and injured children are the sentence to this invasion.\n\nEveryone, I emphasize, everyone must do everything they can to stop this war. Every day of aggression destroys normal life not only in Ukraine, but also in Russia, and in Europe, in the world.\n\nEuropeans do not imagine yet what it is like to live when there is such a confrontation next to you. I have to say absolutely frankly: this night will be harder than a day. Many cities of our state are under attack. Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, our boys, our girls in Donbas, cities of the south of Ukraine. Kyiv requires special attention. We cannot lose the capital.\n\nI appeal to our defenders on all frontlines. This night the enemy will use all the forces available to break our resistance. Treacherously, viciously, inhumanly. This night they will make an assault upon us. We all have to understand what we are going to face. This night we have to withstand. The fate of Ukraine is now being decided. Each civilian should be as careful as possible. Help, please, each other, especially elderly people, lonely, those for whom it is very difficult now. In case of any danger go to the shelter.\n\nEveryone who has already joined the country\'s defense or can help defend, stop the enemy everywhere you can. Remove special signs that saboteurs leave on the roads and buildings. Burn the enemy’s equipment with anything you can. If even kindergartens are a permissible target for invaders, you must not leave them any chance.\n\nAll thoughts, all prayers of Ukrainians are with our military. We believe in them, take care of them. Defend our state. The night will be tough, very tough. But the morning will come.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ',description:"Today was a hard yet courageous day.

For 1.5 days now, the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting the occupier on all fronts.

You, fellow citizens, should turn yourself to the same format of work.\n\nJoin the ranks of the Armed Forces and the Defence Forces, help the military, help volunteers and medical community.\n\nThis is our homeland and we must do everything to protect its sovereignty and freedom.\n\nWe held an extraordinary meeting of the Government today. We took several decisions necessary to support the army, stable functioning of hospitals and critical infrastructure during military time in connection with Russia's aggression against Ukraine.\n\nFirst. Due to the martial law, the State Treasury Service, together with the Ministry of Finance, will redistribute funds to finance the strengthening of national security and defence, urgent measures under the martial law and payments.\n\nSecond. The Government has decided to make state domestic borrowings of up to UAH 400 billion through the gradual issuance of military bonds.\n\nThird. In connection with the imposition of martial law, we have approved additional types of financial support for the military.\n\nFourth. The Government has decided that the funds received by Ukrainians from the state for vaccination under the President's program ePidtrymka can be used to help the army. The money can either be transferred to help Ukrainian military to the International Charitable Foundation Come Back Alive or be credited to a special account of the National Bank, opened to raise funds for the army.\n\nFifth. Ports of Ukraine are under increased protection. The Cabinet of Ministers has established the level 3 of protection in sea and river ports of Ukraine, port facilities, vessels that have the right to sail under the State Flag of Ukraine for the period of martial law.\n\nSixth. By the decision of the Government for the period of martial law, the leaders of the territorial defence zone have the right to decide independently what humanitarian aid and what amount of it is needed. The State Customs Service and Border Guards must ensure the immediate clearance of such assistance to be delivered to hospitals, the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Territorial Defence Forces.\n\nSeventh. We are introducing a temporary suspension of blood exports. The Ministry of Health will also approve the scope of mandatory provision of the healthcare system with donated blood and blood products.\n\nAnd more. I want to address our international partners.\n\nThere are core moments for each nation, which become a part of history textbooks aftermath. Moments when you must decide - to swallow the actions of the aggressor or to repel them. And now it is such a moment.\n\nThe moment when Europe, the U.S and the whole civilized world must unite and stop the aggressor and his war against Ukraine. We call on all civilized countries to impose an embargo on oil products from Russia, to ban Russian citizens from entering your territory, to disconnect Russia from the SWIFT system.\n\nWe call on NATO, Europe, the United States - close the skies over Ukraine. This won’t mean your military confrontation with Russia. This means that you stop the war and your descendants will remember you as heroes.\n\nWe, in turn, will continue to defend our own land. We won’t give up and will continue to destroy our enemies. We are holding the line.\n\n**Glory to the Ukrainian army!**\n\n**Glory to the Ukrainian people!

Against elementary human rights in Europe. Against all coexistence rules on the continent. Against the fact that European states refuse to divide, yes, to divide the borders by force.\n\nThe cities of Ukraine undergo rocket bombing for the second day already. Tank columns and air strikes are as similar as something Europe has already seen a long time ago - during the Second World War and talked \"never again\" about it. But this is it! Again. Now. In 2022. 75 years after the Second World War completion.\n\nI’m confident you see it - all of you, entire Europe. But we do not see in full what you are going to do. How are you going to protect yourself when you help us so slowly in Ukraine?\n\nI’d like to point out what has already happened. And for this we are grateful. Sectoral sanctions. The United States, Canada, United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand introduced precisely sectoral sanctions against Russia. In particular, against all the largest banks. Against the largest Russian enterprises. Against Russia's access to Western technologies.\n\nBut Russian tanks are still shooting at residential buildings in our cities. Armored vehicles are still attacking, including civilians. Ordinary citizens of Ukraine.\n\nEurope has sufficient force to stop this aggression. What to expect from European states further?\n\nCancellation of visas for Russians? Cutting off Swift? Full isolation of Russia? Recalling ambassadors? Oil embargo? Closure of the sky? Today, all this should be on the table, because it is a threat to us, all of us, all of Europe. You can still stop aggression. We must act without delay.\n\nOrdinary people can also do their part of the job, I'm sure, in every country of the world, in each country of Europe. Go out on the square of your cities and demand peace for Europe, peace for Ukraine, stop this war. Go out, go out on the squares and demand to stop the war. This is our right. This is your right.\n\nWhen bombs fall in Kyiv, this happens in Europe, not only in Ukraine. When missiles kill our people, it's the death of all Europeans. Require more protection for Europe, more protection for Ukraine - as part of a democratic world.\n\nWhile state institutions in Europe are in no hurry with really strong decisions, every European in the capital can already come to our embassy and offer assistance. Demand from your governments more financial, more military assistance to Ukraine. For this help is a help to you. For it is a help to Europe. You help yourself.\n\nIf you have a combat experience in Europe and do not want to look at the indecision of politicians, you can arrive in our state and protect Europe with us where it is now urgently required.\n\nYou have already been blackmailed with gas. Already humiliated. They already want to split and divide you the same way as they are trying to divide Ukraine today.\n\nProtect yourself. Just as we protect yourself.\n\nI want to address Russian Federation President once again. Battles take place all over the territory of Ukraine. Let's sit at the negotiating table. To stop the death of people.\n\nAnd now I want to address the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Stand firmly. You are all we have.

Who is ready to fight with us? Honestly - I do not see such. Who is ready to guarantee Ukraine's accession to NATO? Honestly, everyone is afraid.\n\nToday we heard from Moscow that they still want to talk. They want to talk about Ukraine's neutral status.\n\nI tell all the partners of our state: now is an important moment - the fate of our country is being decided. I ask them: are you with us? They answer that they are with us. But they are not ready to take us to the Alliance.\n\nToday, I asked the twenty-seven leaders of Europe whether Ukraine will be in NATO. I asked directly. Everyone is afraid. They do not answer.\n\nAnd we are not afraid of anything. We are not afraid to defend our state. We are not afraid of Russia. We are not afraid to talk to Russia. We are not afraid to say everything about security guarantees for our state. We are not afraid to talk about neutral status. We are not in NATO now. But the main thing - what security guarantees will we have? And what specific countries will give them?\n\nWe need to talk about the end of this invasion. We need to talk about a ceasefire.\n\nBut now the fate of the country depends entirely on our army, on our heroes, our security forces, all our defenders. And on our people, your wisdom and the great support of all friends of our country.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Today Russia attacked the entire territory of our state.

It's not just rocket explosions, battles, the roar of aircraft. It is the sound of a new Iron Curtain lowering and closing Russia away from the civilized world. Our national task is to make this curtain pass not through our Ukrainian territory, but at the home of Russians.\n\nThe Ukrainian army, our border guards, police and special services stopped the enemy's attacks. In the language of conflict, this can be called an operational pause.\n\nIn Donbas, our Armed Forces are doing great, the Kharkiv direction is very difficult, the forces for the defense of the city are working, they are reliable, they are our men. The most problematic situation today is in the south. Our troops are fighting fierce battles in the suburbs of Kherson. The enemy is pushing out of the occupied Crimea, trying to advance towards Melitopol.\n\nIn the north of the country, the enemy is slowly advancing in the Chernihiv region, but there are forces to hold it. Reliable defense is built in the Zhytomyr region. Enemy paratroopers in Hostomel are blocked, troops are ordered to destroy them.\n\nYes, we, unfortunately, have losses, losses of our heroes. Yes, we have captured Russian soldiers. Our doctors are helping some of them - those who have surrendered. Many Russian aircraft and many armored vehicles were destroyed.\n\nYes, we see that many Russians are shocked by what is happening. Some Russians are already calling on social media that they are against the war. We see it. But the leadership of the Russian Federation is unlikely to see it.\n\nSo please.\n\nIf you hear us, if you understand us, if you understand that you are attacking an independent country, please go out to the squares and address the President of your country.\n\nWe are Ukrainians. We are on our land. You are Russians. Now your military has started a war. The war in our state. I would very much like you to speak on Red Square or somewhere else on the streets of your capital, in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia. Not only in Instagram - it is very important.\n\nWhat do we see at this hour? For the world community, Russia is becoming an analogue of the so-called DPR - this is complete isolation.\n\nI am in constant contact with the leaders of partner countries and international organizations. Russia has already begun receiving the first sanctions from a large package of sanctions, the most powerful in world history.\n\nNo one will be able to convince or force us, Ukrainians, to give up our freedom, our independence, our sovereignty. But it seems that the Russian leadership is trying to do this by destroying the potential of their country. Everything that Russia has done since 2000 can now be burned live in front of the world.\n\nWe emphasize that Ukraine did not choose the path of war. But Ukraine offers to return to peace.\n\nWhat can Ukrainians do? Help the national defense. Join the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and territorial defense units. Any citizen with combat experience will now be useful. It is up to you and all of us whether the enemy will be able to advance further into the territory of our independent state. Please help the volunteer community and the medical system, for example by donating blood.\n\nPoliticians and community leaders - help people, ensure normal life on the ground as much as possible. Everyone should take care of their loved ones and take care of those neighbors or acquaintances who need it. The duty of journalists, an important duty, is to defend democracy and freedom in Ukraine.\n\nI spoke today with many leaders - the United Kingdom, Turkey, France, Germany, the EU, the United States, Sweden, Romania, Poland, Austria and others.\n\nIf you, dear European leaders, dear world leaders, leaders of the free world, do not help us today, then tomorrow the war will knock on your door.\n\n**Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"It's not just rocket explosions, battles, the roar of aircraft.

This is not the first time. \n\nThe war against us is being systematically waged on all fronts. On the military one, they increase the contingent around the border. On the diplomatic one, they are trying to deprive us of the right to determine our own foreign policy course. On the energy one, they limit the supply of gas, electricity and coal. On the information one, they seek to spread panic among citizens and investors through the media.\n\nBut our state today is stronger than ever.\n\nThis is not the first threat that the strong Ukrainian people have faced. Two years ago, we, like the rest of the world, looked confused in the eyes of the pandemic. However, we united and with clear systemic steps practically defeated it. In this difficult time, the strong Ukrainian people have shown their best qualities - unity and the will to win.\n\nUnlike the pandemic two years ago, today we clearly understand all the challenges we face and what to do about them. We are confident, but not self-confident. We understand all the risks. We are constantly monitoring the situation, working out different scenarios, preparing decent responses to all possible aggressive actions.\n\nWe know exactly where the foreign army is near our borders, its numbers, its locations, its equipment and its plans.\n\nWe have something to respond with. We have a great army. Our guys have unique combat experience and modern weapons. This is an army many times stronger than eight years ago.\n\nAlong with the army, Ukrainian diplomacy is at the forefront of defending our interests. We have managed to gain diplomatic support from almost all leaders of the civilized world. Most of them have either already visited and supported Ukraine, or will do so in the near future. Today, everyone recognizes that the security of Europe and the entire continent depends on Ukraine and its army.\n\nWe want peace and we want to resolve all issues exclusively through negotiations. Both Donbas and Crimea will return to Ukraine. Exclusively through diplomacy. We do not encroach on what’s not ours, but we will not give up our land.\n\nWe are confident in our Armed Forces, but our military must also feel our support, our cohesion and our unity. The foothold of our army is the confidence of their own people and a strong economy.\n\nWe have formed sufficient reserves to repel attacks on the hryvnia exchange rate and our financial system. We will not ignore any industry that will need government support. As it happened the other day with airlines. And evidence of this is a stable hryvnia exchange rate and open skies.\n\nAn important front of defense is the objective coverage of the situation by the domestic media. And now I want to address our Ukrainian journalists. Some of you sometimes have to perform the tasks of media owners. Most of them have already fled their own country.\n\nWork for Ukraine, not for those who fled. The fate of the country today depends on your honest position.\n\nAnd now I want to address not those who stayed with Ukraine and in Ukraine, but those who left it at the most crucial moment. Your strength is not in your money and planes, but in the civic position you can show. Return to your people and the country due to which you got your factories and wealth. Today, everyone passes a real test for a citizen of Ukraine. Pass it with dignity. Let everyone understand for whom Ukraine is really the Homeland, and for whom it is just a platform for money making.\n\nI address separately all representatives of the state: civil servants, people's deputies of all levels who have fled the country or plan to do so. The people of Ukraine have entrusted you not only to govern the state, but also to protect it. It is your direct duty in this situation to be with us, with the Ukrainian people. I urge you to return to your homeland within 24 hours and stand side by side with the Ukrainian army, diplomacy and people!\n\nWe are told that February 16 will be the day of the attack. We will make it the Day of Unity. The relevant decree has already been signed. On this day, we will hoist national flags, put on blue and yellow ribbons and show the world our unity.\n\nWe have one great European aspiration. We want freedom and are ready to fight for it. 14,000 defenders and civilians killed in this war are watching us from the sky. And we will not betray their memory.\n\nWe all want to live happily, and happiness loves the strong ones. We have never known what it is to give up and we are not going to learn that.\n\nToday is not just Valentine's Day. It is the day of those in love with Ukraine. We believe in our own strength and continue to build our future together. Because we are united by love for Ukraine, united and unique. And love will win. Yes, now you may think it's darkness all around. But tomorrow the sun will rise again over our peaceful sky.\n\n**Love Ukraine!**\n\n**We are calm! We are strong! We are together!**\n\n**Great people of a great country.**\n    ",description:"Our state today is stronger than ever.
