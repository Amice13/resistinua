More than two thousand people in the square.\n\nDo you hear it, Moscow?\n\nIf 2,000 people are protesting against the occupation in Melitopol, how many people should be in Moscow against the war? To make it fair. Yesterday the invaders captured the mayor of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov. The city community is demanding his release. And this is very important.\n\nI am grateful to every Melitopol resident for this resistance, for this position. The invaders must see that they are strangers on our land, on all our land of Ukraine, and they will never be accepted.\n\nThroughout the night and today we constantly talk to our partners about this situation with our mayor. The demand is simple - to release him from captivity immediately.\n\nWe appeal to all world leaders who speak to Moscow. France, Germany, Israel and others.\n\nI have personally called German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. I spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nI will talk to everyone to free our people.\n\nWe expect them, the world leaders, to show how they can influence the situation. How they can do a simple thing - free one person. A person who represents the entire Melitopol community, Ukrainians who do not give up.\n\nOur Armed Forces are doing everything to deprive the enemy of any desire to continue the war against Ukraine. The losses of Russian troops are enormous.\n\nThe dynamics of the invaders’ losses on the 17th day is such that it is safe to say that this is the biggest blow to the Russian army in decades. They’ve never lost more than that in such a time period.\n\nSince the beginning of the invasion, 31 battalion tactical groups of the enemy have lost their combat capability. The Russian militaries are being taken prisoners not just alone, but in groups. Groups are trying to leave Ukraine and come back to Russia as well.\n\nThe losses of the invaders in technical capabilities are simply astounding. More than 360 tanks. 1205 armored vehicles. And that's without counting the losses in the battles this night and in the morning.\n\nAlready almost 60 planes. More than 80 helicopters. Hundreds and hundreds of units of other equipment, including the most modern models, of which Russia is proud.\n\nMost of the world's armies do not have as much as Russian troops lost during the invasion.\n\nUkrainians!\n\nI want you to understand me correctly.\n\nWe have had extraordinary success. The resistance of the entire Ukrainian people against these invaders has already gone down in history. But we have no right to reduce the intensity of defense. No matter how difficult it is. We have no right to reduce the energy of resistance. The enemy is bringing new and new columns to the territory of Ukraine. They are looking everywhere for fighters. Reservists. Conscripts. Mercenaries.\n\nThey are trying to take us with numbers. The number of fighters, the number of equipment. They use terror to break our faith in victory and in Ukraine.\n\nI'm sure they won't succeed. It will not work for them. But in order for them not to succeed, we still have to fight. We still need to be focused. All of us, all Ukrainians, still need to continue to focus on defense. Work together.\n\nWithout internal split. Supporting each other. All over the country. From Uzhhorod to Melitopol. From Chernihiv to Mariupol. From Lviv to Kharkiv.\n\nJust like we all have been doing for 17 days of the war.\n\nToday we again sent humanitarian aid to Mariupol. We will try every day to save our people.\n\nI am grateful to every driver who tries to accomplish this difficult mission.\n\nI am grateful to the representatives of the church who joined the efforts to protect the humanitarian corridor in Mariupol from shelling.\n\nUkrainian troops, for their part, guarantee complete \"silence\" along the entire route so that Mariupol receives food, water and medicine. And so that the civilians of Mariupol can go to a safe area.\n\nHumanitarian corridors from Makariv, Borodyanka, Trostyanets, Sumy, Poltava, Lebedyn, Konotop, Velyka Pysarivka, Krasnopillya, Polohy, Tokmak, Hostomel, Kozarovychi, Mykulychi and Andriivka of the Kyiv region have also been prepared.\n\nThe Russian side must ensure \"silence\" on each of these routes.\n\nOtherwise, what can Russia guarantee in any negotiations?\n\nWe continue to work with Europeans in two directions. The first is Ukraine's accession to the European Union. We are working with the European Commission to agree on all procedures for our movement towards the EU as soon as possible. The second direction is sanctions, it is the top priority.\n\nWe look forward to a new package of European sanctions against Russia to force it to peace. To make it clear: their economy simply will not survive this war.\n\nThe Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has made several very important decisions.\n\nThe complete abolition of value added tax and excise duty for fuel was approved.\n\nFor gasoline, for diesel. This is done not only in the context of the sowing campaign, which should start as usual, but also in the context of the needs of all citizens.\n\nSo that there is no shortage of fuel in the country. So that prices are stable.\n\nThe government has done its part. Now it's up to the deputies.\n\nThey must immediately adopt this decision by their vote. Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Ruslan Stefanchuk is already organizing the relevant sitting.\n\nThe second component is to support those Ukrainian communities that receive our migrants from the areas of hostilities.\n\nThe government has decided to compensate local budgets for utilities payment when accommodating people.\n\nAccording to preliminary estimates, communities in at least ten regions of Ukraine will receive concrete money from the central government to ensure that all IDPs are provided with everything necessary.\n\nUkrainians!\n\nNow all of us have to be efficient in our routine as well.\n\nWe must do our job one hundred percent, help colleagues, take care of our loved ones. And at the same time we must provide everything necessary for our defense. For our defenders.\n\nThis is a patriotic war. This is a people's war.\n\nThis is a war for our independence.\n\nIndependence of not just our state.\n\nBut of everything Ukrainian that was, is and will be in the world.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"The invaders must see that they are strangers on our land, on all our land of Ukraine, and they will never be accepted.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9IxFpRt_h0"},{id:"Hu9gbwav_lA",name:"Today, everyone is gaining glory for Ukraine in his or her place",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"https://youtu.be/Hu9gbwav_lA?t=352",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-11T21:42:06",topics:["Викрадення людей","Терроризм","Гуманітарні коридори","Міжнародні переговори"],cities:["Мелітополь"],text:"\n**Strong people of the steel country!**\n\nThis is how the militaries answer the Kremlin command's question about what prevented them from capturing Ukraine in four days. Strong people of the steel country. This information is unverified, but this fact is indisputable.\n\nAnd if the lost invaders justify their failures with something else, it means that during the 16 days of the war they did not understand anything.\n\nWell, we don’t take it so hard. We are ready to explain. Enlighten the invaders until they fully understand who they are and where exactly they should go. Go out of Ukraine.\n\nToday in Melitopol the invaders captured mayor of the city Ivan Fedorov. A mayor who courageously defends Ukraine and the people of his community.\n\nObviously, this is a sign of the weakness of the invaders.\n\nThey did not find any support on our land. Although they counted on it.\n\nBecause for years they have been lying to themselves that people in Ukraine were supposedly waiting for Russia to come.\n\nThey did not find collaborators who would hand over the city and the power to the invaders.\n\nTherefore, they have switched to a new stage of terror, when they are trying to physically eliminate representatives of the legitimate local Ukrainian authorities.\n\nIt is clear to any democratic state in the world that a legitimately elected mayor is a true representative of the people. Usually it's not about ideology, it's not about politics, it's about the lives of people in a particular community.\n\nProbably Russia has become accustomed to this during the years of autocratic rule.\n\nPerhaps they believe that the mayor is just a boss which is easy to remove, and it means nothing.\n\nBut it is Ukraine here. It is Europe here. It is a democratic world here.\n\nTherefore, the capture of the mayor of Melitopol is a crime not only against a particular person. Not only against a particular community. And not only against Ukraine.\n\nThis is a crime against democracy as such. I assure you that one hundred percent of people in all democracies will know this. The actions of the Russian invaders will be equated with the actions of ISIS terrorists.\n\nThe whole country saw that Melitopol did not surrender to the invaders. Just as Kherson, Berdyansk and other cities where Russian troops managed to enter didn’t. Temporarily managed to enter.\n\nAnd this will NOT be changed by putting pressure on mayors or kidnapping mayors. This can only get worse. For the invaders.\n\nUkraine demands the immediate release of the mayor of Melitopol and guarantees of full security to all heads of communities across the country. If you are becoming an analogue of ISIS terrorists, then what is the point of talking to you about something at all?\n\nWe will raise this issue, including in talks with international mediators who communicate with Moscow.\n\nToday, Russian troops also disrupted the work of most humanitarian corridors.\n\nBut, despite everything, 7,144 people were saved. From Enerhodar, Bucha, Hostomel and Kozarovychi. And these are 7,144 reasons to try to organize evacuation for Ukrainians from the besieged cities tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.\n\nWe will do that. We will do everything to bring humanitarian aid to Ukrainian cities. I have to say this with pain - Mariupol remains blocked by the enemy. Russian troops did not let our aid into the city and continue to torture our people, our Mariupol residents.\n\nTomorrow we'll try again. Once again send food, water and medicine for our city.\n\nI am confident that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will respond to every minute of our people's suffering.\n\nAnd it's not pathos. Not a threat. This is a statement of reality.\n\nThe number of killed Russian servicemen on the territory of Ukraine already exceeds 12 thousand people. 12 thousand! The number of wounded invaders is many times bigger. We did not invite any of them here.\n\nAnd we repeat to each of the invaders: you can still save yourself. At any moment. Just lay down your weapons and go home, leave our land.\n\nThe number of captured invaders has already reached such a level that this issue cannot be left to the structures that we had before the war.\n\nTherefore, today the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine established the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War.\n\nThousands of enemy soldiers who have been captured or surrendered receive from our state the treatment required by international conventions.\n\nBut there are so many of them that a special structure is needed to deal with all related issues.\n\nI want to say it again for Russian mothers. Especially for mothers of conscripts.\n\nDo not send your children to war in a foreign land. Do not believe the promises that they will be sent just somewhere for exercises or just somewhere in non-combat conditions.\n\nCheck where your son is.\n\nAnd if you have even the slightest suspicion that your son may be sent to the war against Ukraine, act immediately. Do not give your son to death or captivity.\n\nUkraine never wanted this dreadful war. And Ukraine doesn’t want it. But it will defend as much as necessary.\n\nFortunately, we are not alone in this battle.\n\nUkrainians have sincere friends. Good partners.\n\nSpeaking in the Polish Parliament today, I paid a lot of attention to the importance of not being alone in today's world. How important it is to protect common values. And as a result - to feel that the borders between nations are blurred.\n\nTo make people closer.\n\nJust like our relationship with Polish brothers and sisters. Just like our relationship with all our sincere partners.\n\nBecause the one who has friends can do anything.\n\nI held talks with US President Biden.\n\nWe discussed how else we can put pressure on Russia to end this war and establish peace.\n\nRussia will be deprived of the opportunity to trade normally with the G7 countries.\n\nThe less dollars Russian business earns and the less taxes the Russian state receives, the less opportunity the Russian military will have to kill our people.\n\nLeading international companies are already leaving the Russian market. The Russian government has put its country outside the global world by starting a war against us. By starting this invasion. This is self-closure. Self-humiliation. Self-destruction.\n\nIn Moscow currency exchange offices, the dollar has already reached 200 rubles. And this is just the beginning. The beginning of international sanctions.\n\nThe next step is the United States’ ban on bringing dollars into Russia.\n\nConsequently, there will be a shortage of currency. So, the course will raise even more. Consequently, prices will rise. Consequently, every citizen of Russia will feel that the absence of peace is a threat to him personally.\n\nNot a single country in the world wished harm to ordinary citizens of Russia. Nobody tried to cause any damage until your government started a war with neighbors, peaceful people. A war of annihilation.\n\nNo one wanted to return ordinary Russian life back to the \"wicked 1990s\". Is that what you call that era? A time of upheaval and poverty. A time of very limited opportunities for ordinary people and very large inequalities.\n\nPerhaps now, due to the efforts of propagandists, most Russians do not yet understand what awaits them. But the Russian authorities ALREADY understand this very well. Very clear. And they are very afraid.\n\nThat is why they are trying to close all free sources of information. Actually all sources of information. Even Instagram and Facebook.\n\nBut the modern world has learned to deal with such censorship.\n\nMy advice to thinking Russians is to look for ways to get truthful information.\n\nAnd try to hide your smartphones and computers from the security forces on the streets. They're getting ready to check what's in people's phones. What do people have in laptops. I specifically warn you: learn to resist the repression that your government plans to increase.\n\nBecause thinking people should be in every country.\n\nAnd in Russia, too. And they are in Russia.\n\nAnd one more thing. Now the good news and the victories of Ukraine for all of us are worth their weight in gold.\n\nOr silver and bronze.\n\nAnd all this - for Ukraine - is successfully won by our Paralympians in Beijing.\n\nToday, everyone is gaining glory for Ukraine. In his or her place. Shows the world who Ukrainians are and what strength we have.\n\nWith a weapon in hands on the battlefield or with a sporting rifle on a biathlon track.\n\nOur boys and girls have already won 25 medals at the Winter Paralympics!\n\nAnd take second place in the overall standings, second only to the hosts of the competition - China.\n\nThe Paralympics will end in two days.\n\nI would very much like to say the same about the war. That it will end in two days.\n\nUnfortunately, this is still unrealistic. But it will definitely happen.\n\nBoth victory for Ukraine and peace for Ukraine are achievable.\n\nAnd they will be more valuable for us than gold, silver and bronze of the whole world.\n\nWell, for now ...\n\n**Hold our ground! Hold on! We will win!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"I am confident that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will respond to every minute of our people's suffering.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu9gbwav_lA"},{id:"rebTHXLyKoU",name:"Iryna Vereshchuk - about the results of the work of humanitarian corridors",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Ірина Верещук"],date:"2022-03-11T21:42:06",topics:["Гуманітарні коридори"],cities:[],text:"Iryna Vereshchuk - about the results of the work of humanitarian corridors",description:"Iryna Vereshchuk - about the results of the work of humanitarian corridors",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rebTHXLyKoU"},{id:"3lvq37c0hnw",name:"Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Sejm of the Republic of Poland",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-11T16:12:11",topics:["Вбиті діти","Міжнародна допомога"],cities:[],text:'\n**Dear Mr. President, my friend Andrzej!**\n\n**Dear Mrs. Marshal of the Sejm! Dear Mr. Marshal of the Senate!**\n\n**Ladies and gentlemen deputies and senators!**\n\n**Dear Sirs!**\n\n**Polish brothers and sisters!**\n\nWhen I became President in 2019, it felt like we had a long way to go with Poland.\n\nBecause our relationship was pretty cold, our attitude towards each other wasn’t too warm.\n\nThis was the situation. But I wanted to go this way fast. The path to warmth.\n\nBecause we are such nations. I knew that we were akin by nature - Ukrainians, Poles.\n\nI remember my first meetings with Andrzej Duda. From meeting to meeting everything changed. The coolness disappeared. We understood each other. As a Ukrainian and a Pole. As Europeans. As friends. As parents who love their families and realize that our children must live in a world of equal good values. Our shared values. They must live in a world where nations are independent, where freedom reigns, where the family matters, and where no one ever has the right to war, to invasion.\n\nIt is believed that the number seven brings happiness. That is how many neighbors God has given to Ukraine. Does it bring us happiness? The whole world knows the answer today.\n\nAnd 78 Ukrainian children who died from rockets and shelling of the Russian Federation know it better than others. A neighbor who brought trouble and war to our land. A neighbor who obviously acts without God.\n\nWhen there is someone who beats like a savage, it is very important to have someone who will lend a hand. And when the foot of the enemy enters your house, he will lend you a helping hand.\n\nOn the morning of February 24, I had no doubt who it would be. Who will say to me: "Brother, your people will not be left alone with the enemy."\n\nAnd so it happened. And I\'m grateful for that. Polish brothers and sisters are with us. And this is natural.\n\nJust in one day, on the first day of the war, it became clear to me and to all Ukrainians, and, I am sure, to all Poles that there are no more borders between us, between our nations. No physical ones. No historical ones. No personal ones.\n\nDuring the 16 days of this war, Ukrainian pride and Polish honor, Ukrainian courage in battles and Polish sincerity in helping us allow me to say very important words now. Words that there is real peace between our nations. Peace between relatives. Peace between brothers. And now I really want these words to be heard by our common Belarusian neighbors.\n\nPeace between relatives, peace between neighbors, peace between brothers. We have to come to this with them as well! We will definitely come!\n\nDear Sirs! Polish brothers and sisters!\n\nFor a long time, various "stakeholders" tried to create an impression that Ukrainians and Poles live differently. And separately. Why did they do all this?\n\nI will recall the words of President of the Republic of Poland Lech Kaczyński said in Tbilisi in 2008: "We know very well: today - Georgia, tomorrow - Ukraine, the day after tomorrow - the Baltic countries and then, perhaps, the time will come for my country - Poland”.\n\nOn February 24, this terrible "tomorrow" for Ukraine came, which President Kaczyński spoke about.\n\nAnd today we are fighting for such a bad time for Poland and the Baltic States to never come. We fight together. We have strength.\n\nRemember, there are 90 million of us together! We can do everything together. And this is the historical mission, the historical mission of Poland, the historical mission of Ukraine to be leaders who together will pull Europe out of this abyss, save it from this threat, stop the transformation of Europe into a victim.\n\nDear Sirs! We can do it.\n\nWe saw yesterday what the countries of the European Union talked about and in what manner. We saw who was the real leader and fought for a strong Europe. For common European security. And who tried to stop us, tried to stop you.\n\nWe understand why it is so important for Poles to fight with us. Together with all those who are for freedom. For us and for you, for Europe.\n\nWe remember the terrible tragedy of 2010 near Smolensk. We remember all the facts of the investigation into the circumstances of this catastrophe. We feel what this means for you. And what does the silence of those who also know all this mean to you, but... But they still feast their eyes on Russia. \n\n**Polish brothers and sisters!**\n\nI feel that we have already formed an extremely strong alliance. Even though it is informal. But this is an alliance that grew out of reality, not words on paper. Of the warmth in our hearts, not of the speeches of politicians at summits. Of the way you treated our people. Ukrainians who fled to your country to escape from the evil that came to our land.\n\nMore than one and a half million citizens of Ukraine! The vast majority are women and children. They do not feel like they are in a strange land. You met our people in your families. With Polish delicacy. With fraternal kindness.\n\nAlthough we did not ask for it. And you did not ask anything for it. It\'s just the way it is between relatives.\n\nThat\'s why I address so simply: friend Andrzej, dear Agata!\n\nThat\'s why I claim that we have already united. We united to constantly gain and create freedom, as a great Pole, a close friend of Ukraine John Paul II said.\n\nToday, I cannot be sure of all the leaders of all European nations, but I am sure that we will definitely be with you in defending freedom. As much as needed.\n\nI am grateful for all the help we have already received from your state, from your people. I am grateful for your efforts so that we can secure the Ukrainian sky. I believe that we will be able to achieve the result in this, the result that we all desperately need.\n\nIf God allows and we win this war, we will share the victory with our brothers and sisters.\n\n**This is our greatness.

This is four times longer than the enemy planned for his invasion.\n\nFour times longer! Against the army, which was considered one of the strongest in the world. Which hoped that the Ukrainians would surrender. Hoped that someone would meet Russian flags on Ukrainian streets, on our streets with flowers.\n\nBut Ukrainians are proud people who always defend their land and will not give the invader a single piece of land. Not a percent of their freedom.\n\n16 days. I know that many people have started to feel tired. I understand. Impatience. I understand.\n\nEmotions play a bad game with people. This is life. When we mobilize, when we see our victories and the loss of the enemy on the battlefield, we expect the struggle to end sooner. We expect the invaders to fall faster. But... This is life, this is war. This is a struggle.\n\nTime is still needed. Patience is still needed. Our wisdom, energy. The ability to do our job to the maximum so that we can win together.\n\nIt is impossible to say how many more days we must liberate our Ukrainian land. But it is possible to say - we will do it! Because we strived for that. Because we have already reached a strategic turning point. We are already moving towards our goal, towards our victory.\n\nThis is a patriotic war. War with a very stubborn enemy who does not pay attention to the thousands of his killed people, killed soldiers. Who is now gathering reservists and conscripts all over Russia to throw them into the hell of this war.\n\nWho came up with the idea of throwing mercenaries against our people. Thugs from Syria. From the country that was destroyed in the same way as the invaders are destroying us now - our Mariupol, our Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, Chernihiv, Volnovakha, Izyum, etc.\n\nThis is how Russian troops treat Ukrainians. This is how they treat Donbas, Russian-speaking people, as they said. How they shouted to everyone about \"protection\", which they talked about so much in Moscow. Rockets, air bombs, artillery. And now Syrian mercenaries who do not distinguish at all who speaks what language here, what church people go to, what party people supported.\n\nMercenaries who simply go to kill in a foreign land - in every sense of the word.\n\nOver the past night and morning, the invaders carried out, as they say, \"demilitarization\" of the water supply system in Chernihiv. The city was left without water. We are doing everything to restore the water supply. Due to constant shelling in parts of the Sumy, Kyiv, Donetsk regions there is no electricity, yes, there are problems with heating, no gas, water. This is a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nHumanitarian catastrophe - two words that have become fully synonymous with the other two words - the Russian Federation.\n\nAt night, the invaders bombed a shoe factory, an apartment building and a kindergarten in Dnipro. For what? How did they threaten the Russian state? They destroyed residential houses in the villages of the Sumy region. They continued torturing Mariupol residents, Kharkiv residents.\n\nThey fired rockets at Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk...\n\nIf this continues, sanctions against Russia are not enough. And I expect, we are already working on this, new sanctions from our partners today.\n\nRussia must pay for this terrible war. Pay daily!\n\nA very important meeting of the leaders of the European Union took place yesterday. Long, substantive. We know what was said at this meeting. What all leaders said. Who specifically spoke. Who supported. Who remained silent. And who tried to make the wording insufficient - for Ukraine, Europe and our common freedom.\n\nHow do we evaluate the decision made?\n\nIt's very simple: it must be stronger. This is not what we expect.\n\nIt is necessary that the decisions of politicians coincide with the mood of their nations, European nations. We are aware of this mood. And they are aware of this mood.\n\nEvery politician is well aware!\n\nThe numbers are different in different countries, but there are polls and support is huge. At least 60 percent stand in favor. And this is the vast majority which stands for Ukraine to be part of Europe!\n\nEuropeans are clearly talking about this. And I'm sure they will clearly tell their politicians about this. If they haven't figured it out yet.\n\nThe decision of yesterday's meeting of EU leaders now reaches the level of the European Commission.\n\nFor implementation. For specific procedures.\n\nThe European Union must do more.\n\nIt must do more for us, for Ukraine. And for itself.\n\nWe are waiting for that. All European nations are waiting.\n\nOur government officials have organized 12 humanitarian corridors today.\n\nCargo with food, water, medicine is already on the way. Izyum, Enerhodar, Volnovakha, Polohy, Bucha, Hostomel, Borodyanka, Andriivka, Mykulychi, Makariv, Kozarovychi, of course, Mariupol.\n\nThe Ukrainian servicemen have ensured \"silence\" for the humanitarian corridors to work.\n\nIf the invaders shoot and disrupt the rescue of people again, they will eventually receive such a response from the world that they themselves will need humanitarian corridors.\n\nOur government officials, despite difficulties, are doing everything to ensure that there is fuel, products, medicines and all goods people need throughout the country.\n\nGasoline, diesel - everything is imported.\n\nThis morning I was asked a question at a daily conference call. Logical question. Given the spring. What about sowing? How to start it, especially in those areas that are temporarily occupied?\n\nMy answer is very simple: all over our land, no matter what, we have to organize a full-fledged sowing campaign this spring. Of course, as much as possible. It all depends on the people and the situation. Because it's about life. Life is more important. It’s about our life. About our dreams. About our future. And therefore, about our victory.\n\nI repeat again and again: when we defend freedom, everyone must be like a full-fledged army.\n\nDo everything we can in our place to get the result we all deserve.

Almost 40,000 people have already been evacuated this day. They were given safety at last. In Poltava, Kyiv, Cherkasy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, Lviv.\n\nHumanitarian cargoes were also delivered. Hundreds of tons of food, medicine.\n\nWe are doing everything to save our people in the cities that the enemy just wants to destroy. Taking into account the work of humanitarian corridors in the previous two days, we have already evacuated about one hundred thousand people.\n\nBut…\n\nMariupol and Volnovakha remain completely blocked.\n\nAlthough we did everything necessary to make the humanitarian corridor work, Russian troops did not cease fire.\n\nDespite this, I decided to send a convoy of trucks to Mariupol anyway. With food, water, medicine. I am grateful to the drivers - brave people who were ready to fulfill this mission. An extremely important mission.\n\nBut the invaders started a tank attack exactly in the area where this corridor was supposed to be. Corridor of life. For the people of Mariupol.\n\nThey did it consciously. They knew what they were disrupting. They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to torture it, to carry out constant bombardment.\n\nToday they destroyed the building of the main department of the State Emergency Service in the Donetsk region. Right next to this building was the place where Mariupol residents were to gather for evacuation.\n\nThis is outright terror. Blatant terror.\n\nFrom experienced terrorists.\n\nThe world needs to know that. It has to admit it. We are all dealing with a terrorist state.\n\nBut no matter what, we will try! Constantly! We will continue to try to bring to Mariupol the aid that people so desperately need. Ukrainians need.\n\nThe invaders are doing everything to deceive our people in the besieged cities.\n\nThey block communication. Prevent the provision of Information. The state is doing everything to help our city.\n\nEverything to tell the people of Mariupol: we are fighting. And we will not give up this fight.\n\nTherefore, if you have the opportunity to talk to the people of Mariupol, to write to the people of Mariupol, spread the truth. Remind them that Ukraine is with them wholeheartedly and is doing everything to stop the torture of the city.\n\nRussian propagandists have substantially intensified their activity today. And they tried very hard.\n\nProbably in order to cover up the crimes of their army in Ukraine. Crimes against Mariupol. Against Donbas. Against Kharkiv. Against dozens of other cities.\n\nCover them up with new accusations. New-old fakes.\n\nThey accuse us... Again us! That we are allegedly developing biological weapons. Allegedly, we are preparing a chemical attack.\n\nThis makes me really worried, because we’ve been repeatedly convinced: if you want to know Russia's plans, look at what Russia accuses others of.\n\nLook, spreading such accusations in the Russian media shows that it is THEY who are capable of this. The Russian military, the Russian special services. It shows that they want it.\n\nThey have already done such things in other countries. Similar! They themselves announced, they themselves organized, they themselves complained. And they will do so again.\n\nAgain and again. If they are not stopped.\n\nThey tore apart Moldova with Transnistria. They tore apart Georgia with Abkhazia. They tore apart Ukraine with Donbas and Crimea.\n\nBut they blame us! Those who have become victims.\n\nThose who are forced to defend themselves. Fight for the right to live.\n\nThey themselves come to us in tanks and with missiles.\n\nThey take something that doesn’t belong to them. Capture.\n\nThey are even ashamed to show their officers! They hide their generals. They conceal from their own people that they are sending conscripts to this war only to make the invasion forces larger.\n\nBut we are to blame! We are accused of attacks on allegedly peaceful Russia.\n\nAnd now what? What are these allegations of preparing chemical attacks? Have you decided to carry out \"de-chemicalization\" of Ukraine? Using ammonia? Using phosphorus? What else have you prepared for us?\n\nWhere will you strike with chemical weapons?\n\nAt the maternity hospital in Mariupol? At the church in Kharkiv? At the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital?\n\nOr at laboratories, most of which have remained since Soviet times and are engaged in ordinary science. Ordinary!\n\nNOT military technology.\n\nWe are adequate people. I am the President of an adequate country, an adequate nation. And the father of two children.\n\nAnd no chemical or any other weapons of mass destruction were developed on my land.\n\nThe whole world knows that.\n\nYOU know that.\n\nAnd if YOU do something like that against US, you will get the most severe sanctions response.\n\nUkrainians! Our defenders!\n\nI have signed several important decrees.\n\nAbout awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to thirteen of our defenders:\n\nLieutenant Colonel Litun Andriy Mykolayovych. Posthumously. He died covering our troops and heroically restraining the enemy's offensive.\n\nCaptain Korpan Oleksandr Bohdanovych. Posthumously. He saved our soldiers and civilian houses when he took the falling aircraft away from them.\n\nJunior Lieutenant Blokha Yuriy Ihorovych. Posthumously. In the battles in the Mykolaiv region he heroically protected brothers-in-arms, saving their lives.\n\nSenior Sergeant Ivashko Andriy Oleksandrovych. Posthumously. During the rocket fire, he personally provided information about the enemy's actions at the cost of his own life.\n\nJunior Sergeant Volkov Yevhen Volodymyrovych. Posthumously. For courage and heroism during the evacuation of the wounded in the Donetsk region, for saving our military.\n\nMajor General Nikoliuk Viktor Dmytrovych. He skillfully led the defense in the north-eastern direction and managed to prevent the capture of Chernihiv.\n\nColonel Khoda Leonid Oleksiyovych. During the war, under his command, more than 50 enemy vehicles were destroyed.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Ponomarenko Vyacheslav Anatoliyovych. Thanks to his actions, a significant number of enemy’s equipment and soldiers in the city of Hostomel were destroyed.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Yakovenko Oleksandr Oleksiyovych. He withdrew his units from the enemy artillery fire, thanks to which he saved personnel and continued to successfully defend the Donetsk region.\n\nMajor Bova Yevhen Petrovych. For the heroic defense of Mariupol and holding positions under constant enemy attacks.\n\nCaptain Boyechko Vasyl Vasyliovych. For the extremely successful destruction of enemy equipment and manpower.\n\nSergeant Moroz Oleh Romanovych. Thanks to his heroic deeds, the enemy's offensive in the Luhansk region was stopped.\n\nSailor Samofalov Valeriy Mykhailovych. In one battle, for the first time in the history of this war, he shot down three enemy helicopters.\n\nI also signed a decree awarding orders for personal courage to 39 national guardsmen, 31 policemen (9 posthumously), 14 border guards (4 posthumously) and 23 employees of the State Emergency Service.\n\nToday the rank of Brigadier General is awarded to:\n\nNechayev Oleh Oleksandrovych. For the successful defense of the Kyiv region.\n\nLishchynsky Vladyslav Vatslavovych. For extremely successful actions against the enemy in the Kherson region.\n\nHutsol Volodymyr Volodymyrych. For the successful destruction of enemy airborne troops in Vasylkiv.\n\nDemyanchyk Hryhoriy Petrovych. For the successful organization of personnel training for our military units.\n\nAnd finally.\n\nDiscussions on Ukraine's future in the EU continue today and tomorrow in Europe.\n\nI believe that our people, our state, our army did everything for us to be welcome there. As equals. For us to be invited there.\n\nThis is the final exam for Europe.\n\nAmong the leaders of the states there are those who support us. And there are also those who support only themselves.\n\nBut we see how the nations of all European countries treat us. And this is the main thing.\n\nBecause I know for sure - if people decided on our membership in the EU, they would definitely choose the people of Ukraine.\n\nToday, when I see the support of the people of each country in the squares of European capitals, I know that the Ukrainian people are already in the European Union.\n\nAnd politicians... I'm sure they will adjust to that.\n\nPreferably faster.\n\n**Glory to the nations of Europe!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n\n**Glory to our military!**\n\n**Thank you!**\n    ",description:"We are doing everything to save our people in the cities that the enemy just wants to destroy.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr8vf0MnUkg"},{id:"xFMk4xoPQtU",name:"Росія — це держава-терорист",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Денис Шмигаль"],date:"2022-03-10T22:11:46",topics:["Міжнародна допомога","Посівна","Соціальні виплати","Членство в ЄС","Воєнний злочин"],cities:["Маріуполь"],text:"\n**Heroic people of Ukraine.**\n\nFor 15 consecutive days, Europe is suffering from a war being the biggest since World War II.\n\nYesterday, after bombing a children’s hospital and a maternity hospital in Mariupol, the whole world once again got ascertained that russia is not just an aggressor. Russia is a terrorist state.\n\nUkraine will win this war! Our main task is to bring this victory closer.\n\nThe whole civilized world, which is now united around Ukraine, is helping us in that. And it's not just about governments of different countries, but also about ordinary people around the world, and about companies that operate around the world.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives has approved a $ 13.6 billion emergency aid package for Ukraine. These are funds that will be used to reinforce our army, to provide humanitarian aid and support for Ukrainians. We are grateful to our American friends for such powerful support.\n\nWe are just as much grateful to our friends and partner countries all around the world for isolating the russian federation, we are grateful to the companies that left the Russian market as well. We are grateful to the leaders of the European Union for the next package of punitive sanctions against russia. The aggressor felt that the entire world rose against it. And it is only going to get worse.\n\nIn the coming days, the European Union will consider granting Ukraine an EU candidate status. This issue will become one of the key determinants in the history of Europe and the European Union for years to come. We are, definitely, looking forward to this from our European partners.\n\nThat is why we appeal not only to European leaders, but also to all citizens of a Greater Europe: support Ukraine now. Ukraine has definitely deserved the right to become a member of the European Union.\n\nThe citizens of the EU Member States must speak out so that your governments have no doubt as to what decision they must take.\n\nTogether with the whole world, we continue to forge our victory. For this purpose, Ukraine is switching to the war economy.\n\nEnergy security and operation of critical infrastructure. Defense-industrial complex. Agro-industrial complex. Logistics. The successful operation of these sectors are also integral components of our victory.\n\nCurrently, among the essential topics on the agenda of the Government is organizing a sowing campaign in those regions of our country not affected by active hostilities. Our priority is food crops.\n\nWe have intensified our work with agrarians in this direction so that Ukraine can fully satisfied the needs and have the required amount of food. The work of food industry enterprises in the areas currently not being at the forefront must be resumed.\n\nI want to appeal to businesses again. Resume production where possible. Return your staff back to work.\n\nThe state, in turn, does its job.\n\nToday the Government has increased the expenditures of the reserve fund of the state budget by UAH 50.8 billion. This will allow the needs of the security and defense sector to be promptly met under martial law.\n\nDuring March, a UAH 38.3 billion resource has already been allocated for pension payments. In the last two days alone, the Government has financed UAH 13.9 billion for pension payments.\n\nMoreover, today we have approved the procedure for using the already announced eDocument. It can be generated in the Diia application and the portal.\n\nThe eDocument will contain all the necessary information and a QR-code for identification. This will help Ukrainians who lost their documents as a result of war to prove their identity if necessary.\n\nStep by step, we will stop the aggressor and liberate the occupied territories. And everyone of us must do the job and exert every effort to bring this day closer.\n\n**Glory to Ukrainians! Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Ukraine will win this war!

We lost three people, including a child, a girl. The number of wounded is 17. These are children, women, medical workers.\n\nYou know, this topic was mentioned on Russian television. It was on their talk show. But not a word of truth was said. The Russians were lied to that there had been no patients in the hospital and no women or children in the maternity hospital. The Russians were lied to that \"nationalists\" had allegedly taken up positions there. They lie confidently, as always.\n\nWar crimes are impossible without the propagandists who cover them up. I want to tell them one thing: you will bear responsibility just as all those who give orders to bomb civilians. We will find all the property of the propagandists and their associates. We will do our best to confiscate it wherever it is. You love a rich life. Love prosperous countries. You will not have this anymore. And this is just the beginning.\n\nYou will definitely be prosecuted for complicity in war crimes. And then, it will definitely happen, you will be hated by Russian citizens. Everyone whom you have been deceiving constantly, daily, for many years in a row. When they feel the consequences of your lies in their wallets, in their shrinking possibilities. In the stolen future of Russian children.\n\nWar is never isolated. It always beats both the victim and the aggressor. The aggressor just realizes it later. But it always realizes and always suffers.\n\nToday, we are once again providing humanitarian corridors for our cities. The buses have already departed, the trucks are already on their way - with food, water, medicine.\n\nMariupol, Volnovakha, Izyum, Sumy and the region. Cities and towns of the Kyiv region - Bucha, Borodyanka, Irpin, Hostomel... My heart is broken by what the invaders did to our cities, to our state! And by what they want to do to our people who need urgent help.\n\nRussian troops have already created a humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine. But for them it is part of the plan. They want to humiliate our people. Make them take bread and water from the hands of the invaders standing on their knees. So that Ukrainians can save their lives just by going to the occupied territories or to Russia. That's why they are blocking Mariupol, that's why they are blocking Volnovakha, blocking other cities.\n\nThe invaders specially organize this torture to give their propaganda channels new material. Just for that. Monsters.\n\nDespite everything, updated information was received every hour yesterday about people whom we managed to evacuate to the free territory of Ukraine. In total, more than 60,000 of our citizens were rescued yesterday plus those who did not have time until night and continued the evacuation in the morning.\n\nI spoke today, in particular about that, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. About the torture of our cities, our people. I spoke with French President Macron.\n\nI felt in a conversation with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson that our anti-war coalition will soon become much stronger. Consequently, the pressure on Russia for peace will also be much stronger. For us, specifics in relations with world leaders, with European leaders are very important.\n\nWe are really fighting for our independence! For freedom, for equality for all on the continent! That is why we want to see from partners the decisions based on reality, not on declarations or abstract considerations.\n\nThese days, the EU leaders will convene to discuss Russia's war against Ukraine. To discuss our application for EU membership. We are waiting for a concrete signal. We look forward to strong support. Because it will be fair, real, human, European.\n\nWe know exactly the position of every leader. We know exactly who stands with us and who thinks that the European Union is just accounting, profits, expenses and nothing more. We will work, we will persuade. Life will convince them.\n\n**Ukrainians! Our defenders!**\n\nWe all have been defending our state for the 15th day. We endured. The Ukrainian army is repelling attacks in key directions. Thanks to our military, National Guards, border guards, police, territorial defense and everyone who joined the defense of the state, we have not become slaves, and will never become!\n\nBecause this is our spirit, this is our destiny. Pride for our Armed Forces of Ukraine is boundless!\n\nAfter the war, after our victory, we will rebuild everything that was destroyed.\n\nVery quickly and with a very high quality. A special state program for reconstruction will be created for each affected city. I have already instructed the government to start the elaboration.\n\nChernihiv and Sumy, Okhtyrka and Zhytomyr, Izyum, Mariupol and all our beautiful cities to which evil has come will not see a single trace of the Russian invasion.\n\nThe best architects, the best companies, the best projects. For every city! I want to say this on the example of Kharkiv. Our Kharkiv, which is now experiencing the worst suffering since World War II.\n\nSaltivka, Oleksiivka... Perhaps most Ukrainians know nothing about these names. But the people of Kharkiv will hear. Freedom Square will be such that everyone, all of us, all Europeans will be there! Poltava Way, Belgorod Highway, Myronosytska Street, Regional Children's Hospital, Kharkiv Oncology Center, Karazin University, Labor Palace, Korolenko Library.\n\nWe will rebuild everything! I promise you personally. Kharkiv residents will see that Ukraine stands with them. And it really does.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Воєнні злочини неможливі без пропагандистів, які їх прикривають.

Ukrainians! Mariupol residents!**\n\nToday is the day that defines everything. Defines who is on whose side. Russian bombs fell on a hospital and maternity hospital in Mariupol. Children's hospital. Maternity hospital that is functioning! Buildings are destroyed. As of now, there are 17 wounded. Disassembly of the debris is still ongoing. People began to hide from the air threat in time.\n\nFrom 500 kg aviation bombs dropped by the invaders on Ukrainian cities. Many times already.\n\nChildren's hospital. Maternity hospital. What did they threaten the Russian Federation with? What kind of country is this - the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals and maternity hospitals and destroys them? Were there little Banderivtsi? Or were pregnant women going to fire at Rostov? Did someone in the maternity hospital abuse Russian-speakers? What was that? Was it the denazification of the hospital?\n\nIt is beyond atrocities already. Everything that the invaders are doing to Mariupol is beyond atrocities already. Europeans! Ukrainians! Mariupol residents! Today, we must be united in condemning this war crime of Russia, which reflects all the evil that the invaders brought to our land.\n\nAll destroyed cities. What they did to Volnovakha, Kharkiv, Izyum, Okhtyrka, Chernihiv, Borodyanka, Hostomel, Zhytomyr and dozens of other Ukrainian cities, which never posed any threat to the Russian Federation.\n\nDestroyed hospitals. Destroyed schools, churches, houses. And all the people killed. All the children killed.\n\nThe air bomb on the maternity hospital is the final proof. Proof that the genocide of Ukrainians is taking place.\n\nEuropeans! You won’t be able to say that you didn't see what happened to Ukrainians, what happened to Mariupol residents. You saw. You know.\n\nTherefore, you must increase sanctions against Russia so that it no longer has any opportunity to continue this genocide.\n\nYou must put pressure on Russia to force it to sit down at the negotiating table and end this brutal war.\n\nMoscow knows very well that Mariupol is also the Donetsk region. We have heard so much from Russia about the inhabitants of the Donetsk region. So many accusations, so many demands... And now we see how Russia actually treats the residents of the Donetsk region. Treats ordinary people who live in the houses of Mariupol, work at the enterprises of the city of Mariupol, are treated in hospitals of Mariupol and give birth to children, imagine, people like you give birth to children in the maternity hospitals of Mariupol.\n\nWe have not done and never would have done anything similar to this war crime to any of the cities of the Donetsk, Luhansk or any other region. To any of the cities on earth. Because we are people. And you?\n\nI spoke today with European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. We also worked and spoke with Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. Thank you for your support, Boris.\n\nThe partners are fully informed about what is happening in our Mariupol. And about the situation in all other regions of Ukraine, where hostilities continue. We are working to make Russia feel the consequences of its actions. We are doing everything to finally secure our sky. I am grateful to the vast majority of Ukrainians who support this position. Those who collect signatures, who convince their acquaintances in the West, write on social networks, organize rallies.\n\nTogether we must return courage to some Western leaders. So that they finally do what they had to do on the first day of the invasion. Either close the Ukrainian sky from Russian missiles and bombs, or give us fighter jets so that we can do everything ourselves. A pause without a decision has become simply deadly.\n\nToday we managed to organize the work of three humanitarian corridors. From the city of Sumy, from the cities and towns of the Kyiv region and from Enerhodar.\n\nIn total, about 35,000 people were rescued. We will continue tomorrow. We are preparing six corridors. We pray that people will be taken out of Mariupol, Izyum, Volnovakha, etc. Taken to safe cities of our free Ukraine.\n\nAnd I am sure that every Ukrainian whose help these people need will do everything possible to make them feel our care. Until they can return home.\n\nAnd finally. Every year on March 9, the winners of the Shevchenko Prize are announced. Our national award for the most significant contribution to the preservation and development of the Ukrainian spirit, our national culture.\n\nI believe that our traditions must be observed during martial law and the fierce battles for our freedom. We must not betray them so that we preserve all ours, Ukrainian, completely while we are heading to victory. While we are heading to peace.\n\nThe decree was signed. Now I look forward to meeting the winners. But after the victory. After the victory of Ukraine.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Russian bombs fell on a hospital and maternity hospital in Mariupol. Children's hospital.

The 14th day of our unity. Truly all-Ukrainian. The scale of the threat to the state is maximum. The invasion contingent has already brought into our territory almost everyone who was gathered to invade Ukraine. But the scale of our answer is maximum as well. And these are two different words \"maximum\". \n\nThey have only equipment. At the maximum. We have our people in addition to the equipment. Up to the mark. They only have orders. To attack, to kill, to abuse. And we have a real desire of millions of Ukrainians to win. Defend ourselves. Clear our state...\n\nAnd on the renewed land\n\nThere will be no enemy, adversary,\n\nAnd there will be a son, and there will be a mother,\n\nAnd there will be people on the land.\n\nToday is Taras Shevchenko's birthday. This is our old dream. It is his dream to clean the land. And it is alive! And quite real.\n\nUkrainians!\n\nEverything is in our hands! We withstood and inspired the whole world with our determination. There is no such place on earth where they are not aware of the heroism with which the Ukrainian people defend our beautiful land. Even where we are not supported, they know well what we have achieved. And they feel what else we will achieve if we save the country. If we maintain unity. National force. If we continue to respond wisely and boldly to the activity of the enemy who can destroy the walls of our homes, our schools, our churches, who can destroy Ukrainian enterprises, but will never reach our soul, our heart, our ability to live freely and fight boldly.\n\nOur military and territorial defense units managed to replenish the arsenal of our equipment due to the many trophies they took on the battlefield. Enemy tanks, armored vehicles, ammunition will now work for our defense. For our lives. For our country. What could be more humiliating for the invaders? We will beat the enemy with his own weapons. In addition to ours, which the Russian troops have already felt well, so that more and more enemy soldiers and commanders are asking themselves a simple question: why were they sent to this foreign land, to this war? And we have no answer. Except for one word - death.\n\nRussian soldiers!\n\nYou still have a chance to survive. Almost two weeks of our resistance have shown you that we will not give up. Because this is our home. These are our families and children. We will fight until we regain our land and take revenge for all our killed people. For the killed children. You can still be saved if you just leave. Do not believe your commanders when they tell you that you still have a chance in Ukraine. Nothing is waiting for you here. Except for captivity, except for death. You take our lives and give yours. And we know - we have communications interception - that your commanders already understand everything.\n\nThis war must be ended. We must return to peace. Leave our home, go back to yours.\n\n14 days of a full-scale brutal war. Terror against our people.\n\nDestruction of cities, blockade of entire districts, constant bombing... 14 days of absence of a vital decision. Not our decision! We would make that decision in hours if we had to help our friends.\n\nFrom the first day of the Russian invasion, Ukraine has been repeating to its partners that if you do not close the sky, you will also be responsible for this catastrophe, a large-scale humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nRussia uses missiles, aircraft, helicopters against us, against civilians, against our cities, against our infrastructure. This is the world's humanitarian duty to respond. But... There is no decision.\n\nWe are grateful to Poland for the alternative - for its readiness to provide Ukraine with combat aircraft. The problem is in logistics. In fact, it is a technical issue. It must be solved! Immediately.\n\nThere is an official decision of Poland to transfer the planes to the relevant base - the American base. We also have confirmation - we have all heard - that the agreement between the American party and Poland has been reached. But at the same time we hear that Poland's proposal is allegedly unfounded. And that's what they say in Washington. We also read this. So when will the decision be made? Listen: we have a war! We do not have time for all these signals. This is not ping pong! This is about human lives! We ask once again: solve it faster. Do not shift the responsibility, send us planes.\n\nYesterday we finally managed to organize a humanitarian corridor. From the city of Sumy to Poltava. 1,600 students and 3,500 residents were rescued. Evacuation of people from cities and towns of the Kyiv region continues. More than 18,000 people have already been rescued from Dymer, Vorzel and Irpin. Today we will do everything to continue the functioning of humanitarian corridors. Sumy - Poltava. Izyum - Lozova. Enerhodar - Zaporizhzhia. Mariupol - Zaporizhzhia. Vorzel, Bucha, Borodyanka, Hostomel to Kyiv. Our government officials are working on this, our servicemen have created all the conditions. If there is at least one shot, full responsibility lies with the invaders.\n\nAnd you have already seen the world’s response. Powerful. Sanction packages.\n\nIn the morning I spoke with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. We have full understanding. Full support. Our delegation returned from Belarus last night, from negotiations. I will listen to their report. We will prepare for the next rounds of talks. For the sake of Ukraine. For peace.\n\nAnd finally. Concerning our unity. This is our strength. This is what is needed at this time. We are receiving a lot of signals that someone in Ukraine has decided that he or she may not fight anymore together with everyone. And tries somehow separately, for something personal, for some personal benefit...\n\nWe are receiving various signals that some politicians are looking for threads to Russia again.\n\nAnd some others are again working for a split, contrary to unity.\n\nI want to say one thing and only once: I see what you are doing. If I hear another signal, the answer will be quick. As befits wartime.\n\nThank God, our people have already sorted everything and everyone out.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Ukrainians withstood and inspired the whole world with their determination - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyi",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTc7AVOIOng"},{id:"NgZQWm1cCis",name:"The world does not believe in the future of Russia",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-08T23:35:59",topics:["Секторальні санкції","Гуманітарні коридори","Поранені діти"],cities:["Олешки","Бердянськ","Мелітополь","Запоріжжя"],text:"\n**Українці! Українки!**\n\nСьогодні важливі новини. Сполучені Штати зробили крок, який відчутно послабить окупантів. Змусить платити за агресію, відповідати за зло, яке вони наробили. За все зло. Америка забороняє імпорт нафти з Росії, нафтопродуктів, газу, вугілля. Забороняє громадянам США будь-які інвестиції в російський паливно-енергетичний комплекс.\n\nЯ вдячний особисто Президенту Сполучених Штатів Америки Байдену за це рішення. За це лідерство. За цей максимально потужний сигнал усьому світу. Він дуже простий: кожен цент, сплачений Росії, вона перетворює на кулі та снаряди, які летять в інші суверенні держави.\n\nАбо Росія матиме повагу до міжнародного права і не буде вести війни, або вона не матиме грошей, щоб війни розпочинати. Знайдуть іншу бензоколонку. Але це не тільки про гроші. Заборона на імпорт нафти до США послабить державу-терориста економічно, політично та ідеологічно. Бо це – про свободу, про майбутнє. Про те, куди буде рухатися світ.\n\nЗаборону на імпорт нафти та нафтопродуктів із Росії запроваджує і Велика Британія.\n\nЯ вдячний Премʼєр-міністру Борису Джонсону за принциповість, на яку очікуєш від глави уряду Великої Британії у важкі часи.\n\nВиступаючи сьогодні у британському парламенті, я згадав інші важкі часи. Інші, але такі подібні. 1940 рік, коли тиранія загрожувала, як вона думала, невеликому острову. І була впевнена, що острів не витримає жорстоких ударів, бомбардувань і блокади.\n\nА вийшло, що острів зміг більше, ніж та тиранія. Бо мав мудрість. Мав витримку. Друзів. І силу. І вірив у майбутнє – своє та свободи у Європі. Як віримо ми. Як боремося ми. І як ми переможемо.\n\nПогляньте: світ не вірить у майбутнє Росії, не говорить про нього. Жодного слова, жодної перспективи. Вони все розуміють. Вони говорять про нас. Вони допомагають нам. Вони готуються підтримати нашу відбудову. Після війни. Бо всі побачили: для народу, який так героїчно захищається, обовʼязково настане оце «після війни».\n\nБуде і новий план Маршалла для України. Захід сформує цей пакет підтримки. Сьогодні про це сказав британський Премʼєр-міністр. Людина слова, щирий друг України.\n\nВже очікуємо і жорстких рішень від Європейського Союзу. Санкційних. Проти Росії. За цю війну. За цю агресію. Про яку її автори ще пошкодують. Це буде. Обов'язково. І тому так важливо, щоб у керівництві Росії усвідомили: США, Велику Британію, Євросоюз, Канаду, Австралію, Японію та інші вільні країни світ буде тільки наслідувати. А отже, його не обманути. Санкції не обійти.\n\nЯ вдячний тим росіянам, які нас підтримують, виходять на вулиці і борються. Борються щоденно за нас і за себе. Тому що борються за мир.\n\nВійну треба закінчувати. Треба сідати за стіл переговорів. Але чесних, предметних, в інтересах людей, а не застарілих убивчих амбіцій.\n\nГоворив сьогодні з Марком Рютте – Прем'єр-міністром Нідерландів. У нас – нова сторінка у відносинах з Нідерландами. Дякую за підтримку. З Прем'єр-міністром Ізраїлю Беннетом. Премʼєр-міністром Люксембургу Бетелем та з Президентом Франції Макроном. Маємо підтримку. Маємо розуміння.\n\nМабуть, ви бачили сьогодні у новинах історію про те, що ООН нібито не вважає російське вторгнення війною. Я знаю, це обурило багатьох, і не тільки в Україні.\n\nВдячний нашій команді. Ми все зʼясували, швидко отримавши запевнення: у структурах ООН не буде брехні. Не буде підігравання агресору. Слово «війна» звучатиме на цьому майданчику. Бо це правда. Ми не дозволимо нікому у світі ігнорувати страждання та вбивства наших людей, наших дітей.\n\nСьогодні, коли я йшов виступати перед британським парламентом, найстрашнішим числом було для мене 50. 50 убитих українських дітей за 13 днів війни. А вже за годину стало 52. 52 дитинки. Ніколи не пробачу цього. І знаю, що ви ніколи це не пробачите окупантам.\n\nЯк Харків, Маріуполь і всі інші міста. Ввечері вони завдали ракетного удару по Корбутівці у Житомирській області. Зруйнували гуртожиток.\n\nЧим міг загрожувати Росії звичайний гуртожиток? Яким геополітичним інтересам ядерної держави? Вічна памʼять усім людям, яких убили ці нелюди.\n\nСьогодні нам вдалося організувати гуманітарний коридор з міста Суми до Полтави. Сотні людей врятовано. Гуманітарний вантаж доставили. Але це – лише відсоток від того, що треба зробити. Чого очікують наші люди, заблоковані українці. Ми готові. Наші вантажі готові. Наш транспорт готовий. Але... нелюди – вони не готові. Вони обстрілюють маршрути евакуації. Вони блокують доставку необхідних продуктів та ліків для людей.\n\nЧого вони хочуть? Щоб українці взяли з рук окупантів. Все це просто тортури. Свідомі. Системні. Організовані їхньою державою. Чужою для нас. І безжальною для всіх, навіть для її громадян.\n\nОлешки у Херсонській області. Бердянськ та Мелітополь у Запорізькій області. Усі міста, де українці чинять спротив, де протестують проти окупантів... Знайте: ми з вами. Ми вдячні. Вантажі все одно будуть їхати. Скільки б їх не зупиняли кулі. Гуманітарні коридори все одно працюватимуть. І тільки час відділяє вас від свободи. Недовгий час. Вірте в це. Я вірю. І дуже цього хочу.\n\n**Слава Україні**\n    ",description:"The world does not believe in the future of Russia, yet speaks about Ukraine, helps and is preparing to support our reconstruction after the war - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyi",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgZQWm1cCis"},{id:"Cu2v_W41A6I",name:"Address by the Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Денис Шмигаль"],date:"2022-03-08T17:06:01",topics:["Економіку воєнного стану","Координаційний центр","Соціальні виплати"],cities:["Харків","Миколаїв","Маріуполь","Суми"],text:'\n**Heroic people of Ukraine!**\n\nThe 13th day of Ukrainian hell for the russian aggressor is underway.\n\nOur military is confidently holding the line in the south, north and east of the country, leaving the invaders no chance of encircling major cities.\n\nKharkiv, Mykolayiv, Mariupol, Sumy - these names are known today all over the world.\n\nIn areas close to the combat zones, our heroic pilots, National Guard officers and Territorial Defense fighters effectively repel air strikes and aerial attacks by the enemy’s forces on civilians and critical infrastructure.\n\nUnder the circumstances, all of us have to transform our lives under the "Martial Law Economy" conditions. Every Ukrainian citizen today should ask himself or herself a question - how exactly can I be efficient to the army, country, state?\n\nAnd to realize that war is not just a front. War is also a home front that must be reliable and stable.\n\nIn times of war, it is difficult to do everyday work, you want to see your personal contribution to the victory here and now. But everyone should mind their own business and be where he or she belongs to.\n\nIt is also heroism for everyone to manage to overcome yourself against the backdrop of constant air raid warnings, feelings of anxiety for your relatives and stress, and go to work day after day and do your job. You are all heroes because you work in your country during the war.\n\nThe Government also continues to work for our victory.\n\nOne week ago, a Coordination Center was established to ensure receiving and distributing humanitarian assistance. We have simplified and further simplify the rules for importing such goods, we remove most of the bureaucratic procedures on a daily basis.\n\nAnd on behalf of the Government, I would like to thank our partners, all the people who are lending a helping hand to Ukraine today.\n\nIn the last 6 days, almost 3,000 trucks carrying 20,000 tons of humanitarian aid have crossed the Ukrainian border. These are mainly food, clothing, medicines and medical supplies that the Government is already sending to the regions.\n\nIn addition, more than UAH 10 billion was transferred to an account specially created by the National Bank of Ukraine to support our army.\n\nWe want to thank everyone who helps Ukraine. And for formal assistance. And for the real friendly support!\n\nThe Cabinet of Ministers, meanwhile, is working to ensure that the most vulnerable population groups receive uninterrupted support.\n\nThe Government has adopted a decision that assistance to low-income families, single mothers, children with serious illnesses, and payments to internally displaced persons will be prolonged and there is no need to apply to the social security authorities.\n\nThe second essential direction is benefits and subsidies. The Government has changed the procedure for their accrual. If the local social protection authorities are unable to perform their functions, all payments will be made directly by the Ministry of Social Policy through the Oschadbank branches, even if the beneficiaries have accounts in other banks.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank all the volunteers and social workers who during the war are rendering assistance to those who need such aid the most today - the elderly, the disabled, the critically ill.\n\nAs long as we care about the weakest among us, we are human. We are the people who are invincible! Who will defeat the darkness!\n\n**Glory to Ukrainian citizens!

The holiday of spring. We congratulate Ukrainian women, our girls, wives, mothers.\n\nAlways.\n\nBut not today.\n\nToday, I just can't tell you the traditional words. I just can't congratulate you. I can’t. When there are so many deaths. When there is so much grief. When there is so much suffering.\n\nWhen the war continues. A full-scale terrorist war against our people. The people of Ukraine.\n\nThe invaders bombed Sumy again. With air bombs. Our peaceful city that has never threatened Russia in its history! Good, quiet, soulful Sumshchyna! Which is turned into hell.\n\nMariupol. Peaceful and hard-working city without any internal malice. It was surrounded. Blocked. And is being deliberately exhausted. Deliberately tortured. The invaders deliberately cut off communication. Deliberately block the delivery of food, water supply. Turn off the electricity.\n\nIn Mariupol, for the first time in dozens of years, perhaps for the first time since the Nazi invasion, a child died of dehydration.\n\nHear me, today, dear partners!\n\nA child died of dehydration. In 2022!\n\nWe have been fighting for the thirteenth day. We destroy the invaders wherever we can. Everywhere. But there is a sky. Hundreds of Russian cruise missiles. Hundreds of fighter jets of the invaders. Hundreds of helicopters. Yes, we destroy them.\n\nRussia has not lost as much aircraft in the past 30 years as in these 13 days in Ukraine.\n\nBut they still have enough machinery to kill. There are still enough missiles for terror. They still have enough 500 kg bombs to drop them on us, ordinary people. On Chernihiv and Kyiv. Odesa and Kharkiv. Poltava and Zhytomyr. Dozens and dozens of Ukrainian cities. On millions of peaceful Ukrainian people.\n\nIt has been 13 days of promises. 13 days when we are told that there will soon be help in the sky. There will be planes. They will be handed over to us...\n\nThe blame for every death of every person in Ukraine from air strikes and in blocked cities, of course, lies with the Russian state, the Russian military, those who give and those who carry out criminal orders, who violate all the rules of warfare, who deliberately exterminate the Ukrainian people.\n\nThe fault lies with the invaders. But the responsibility for this lies also with those who have not been able to make an obviously necessary decision somewhere in the West, somewhere in the offices for 13 days. Those who have not yet secured the Ukrainian sky from Russian murderers.\n\nThose who did not save our cities from air strikes. From these bombs, missiles. Although they can.\n\nThose who do not help in lifting the blockade.\n\nHundreds and hundreds of thousands of people in the cities are on the verge of life and death. Literally.\n\nNot as it sounds in the comments of politicians about providing Ukraine with vital combat aircraft. Vital missile defense.\n\nVitally important!\n\nWe have heard many assurances and seen many agreements. In particular, on the creation of humanitarian corridors. To save our citizens in Mariupol. But they didn't work. All of them didn’t work. Yet. And I have no more time to wait. We do not have. Mariupol doesn’t have time to wait.\n\nIt is the invaders who want our people to die. Not us. We sent columns with humanitarian aid to Mariupol. Everything necessary is there! We sent vehicles to rescue people. Drivers understand everything. They are heroes. Brave people! They understand that Russian troops can simply destroy these vehicles on the road. Just as they did, killing people who were just trying to get to a safe territory from the war zone.\n\nBut if you fire at these vehicles, these people, you should know that it will be before the eyes of the whole world.\n\nEveryone will be witnesses. And everyone will testify.\n\nWhen everyone, I repeat this, everyone who gives and fulfills inhuman orders will be severely judged and convicted.\n\nWe have seen the concrete consent of the Russian side to organize an evacuation corridor from the city of Sumy. And not just for our people. For hundreds of foreigners. Citizens of India, China. These are students who studied in Sumy.\n\nYou know, I was told that the Red Cross, the International Red Cross, forbids us to use the emblem on vehicles carrying out humanitarian missions. The Red Cross prohibits it as if it is their property.\n\nAnd this is indicative. This says a lot about the fact that some people, very influential, have decided to give up Ukrainians.\n\nBut we will not allow it. And I will not allow it.\n\nOur friends. They are next to us.\n\nI will appeal directly to the nations of the world if the leaders of the world do not make every effort to stop this war, this genocide.\n\nOf course, we continue to talk to our partners, to the leaders, parliamentarians of all countries who know how to help Ukraine. We have a very busy negotiation period.\n\nI spoke with Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda. The people of Lithuania always stand by Ukrainians in this struggle. We feel this help and appreciate it.\n\nI spoke with President of the European Council, our friend Charles Michel. I also spoke with Prime Minister of India, Mr. Modi.\n\nBut there are things that are not decided in negotiations, that depend not directly on us, but on humanity, which must win in the leading capitals, must overcome fear, must overcome any benefits.\n\nAnd then we will see that the Ukrainian sky is safe and the Ukrainian cities are unblocked.\n\nWe can do this together as people of the world. And if the world stands aloof, it will lose itself. Forever. Because there are unconditional values. The same for everyone. First of all, this is life. The right to life for everyone.\n\nThis is exactly what we are fighting for in Ukraine. Very fiercely, together with our military. This is exactly what these weak invaders want to deprive us of.\n\nThis is exactly what the whole world must protect.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"In the leading capitals, humanity must overcome fear and benefits, and then the Ukrainian sky will be safe, and the cities will be unblocked",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=550kL81akNM"},{id:"ySxmwpRff0E",name:"A briefing by Iryna Vereshchuk",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Ірина Верещук"],date:"2022-03-08T09:11:22",topics:["Гуманітарні коридори"],cities:["Суми"],text:"A briefing by Iryna Vereshchuk on opening of a humanitarian corridor for Sumy",description:"A briefing by Iryna Vereshchuk on opening of a humanitarian corridor for Sumy",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySxmwpRff0E"},{id:"AF1wKMZWM9w",name:"Every day of resistance creates better conditions for Ukraine in the negotiations to guarantee our future in peace",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-07T11:31:18",topics:["Міжнародні переговори","Ракетний удар","Герої України"],cities:["Київ","Чаплинка","Мелітополь","Токмак","Новотроїцьке","Херсон","Старобільськ","Маріуполь","Харків","Чернігів","Суми","Одеса","Миколаїв","Житомир","Коростень","Овруч","Енергодар","Чорнобиль","Макаров"],text:"\nMonday.

And other places where barbarians just don't understand WHAT they want to capture. WHAT they want to control. Your work, your hard work on critical objects is a real feat. And we see it. We are sincerely grateful for it.\n\nThe Ukrainian army holds positions. Well done! It inflicts extremely painful losses on the enemy. Defends. Counterattacks. If necessary - can take revenge. Necessarily. For every evil. For every rocket and bomb. For each destroyed civilian object.\n\nToday in Makariv, Kyiv region, they fired at the bread factory. For what? The old bread factory! Think about it - to fire at the bread factory. Who should you be to do that?\n\nOr to destroy another church - in the Zhytomyr region. The Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin built in 1862.\n\nThese are NOT people.\n\nThere was an agreement on humanitarian corridors.\n\nDid it work? Russian tanks worked instead. Russian \"Grads\". Russian mines. They even mined the road, which was agreed to transport food and medicine for people and children in Mariupol.\n\nThey even destroy buses that have to take people out. But ... At the same time, they are opening a small corridor to the occupied territory. For several dozen people. Not so much to Russia, as to propagandists. Directly to their TV cameras. Like, that's the one who saves. Just cynicism. Just propaganda. Nothing more. No humanitarian sense.\n\nThe third round of negotiations in Belarus took place today. I would like to say - the third and final. But we are realists. So we will talk. We will insist on negotiations until we find a way to tell our people: this is how we will come to peace.\n\nExactly to peace.\n\nWe must realize that every day of struggle, every day of resistance creates better conditions for us. Strong position to guarantee our future. In peace. After this war.\n\nApart from the dead people and the destroyed cities, the war leaves destroyed the aspirations that once seemed very important, but now ... You don't even mention them.\n\nAlmost three years ago, as soon as the election took place, we entered this building, this office, and immediately began planning our move.\n\nI dreamed of moving from Bankova. Together with the government and parliament. To unload the center of Kyiv and in general - to move to a modern, transparent office - as befits a progressive democratic European country.\n\nNow I will say one thing: I stay here.\n\nI stay in Kyiv.\n\nOn Bankova Street.\n\nI’m not hiding.\n\nAnd I'm not afraid of anyone.\n\nAs much as it takes to win this Patriotic War of ours.\n\nToday I signed a decree to present state awards of Ukraine to 96 Ukrainian heroes - our military.\n\nIncluding…\n\nThe Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the second degree is awarded to:\n\nMajor Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Sak. Commander of the mechanized battalion who entered the battle with the battalion tactical group of the enemy and won thanks to a rational approach to combat and non-standard tactics.\n\nCaptain Rostyslav Oleksandrovych Sylivakin. Commander of the mechanized battalion, which successfully fought the overwhelming forces of the enemy, liberating Ukrainian towns and villages in the Sumy region.\n\nThe Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the third degree is awarded to:\n\nLieutenant Ihor Serhiyovych Lozovyi. Acting as part of the group, he stopped a column of enemy vehicles numbering about 150 units, which was moving in the direction of the Zhytomyr-Kyiv route. Destroyed.\n\nLieutenant Vitaliy Viktorovych Poturemets. He showed exemplary courage and composure in the battle, destroying a column of enemy equipment near the city of Kyiv. He was wounded.\n\nThe Order \"For Courage\" of the third degree is awarded to:\n\nMaster Sergeant, Commander of the Automobile Platoon Valentyn Viktorovych Baryliuk. Thanks to his brave actions and personal determination, the tank unit received fuel in time and left the encirclement, destroying the enemy on the way.\n\nAll 96 of our heroes are like these five!\n\nOur gratitude to all the military.\n\nOur gratitude to the Armed Forces of Ukraine!\n\nOur gratitude is boundless.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Everyone.

In the air and on land, day and night, the military of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are heroically fighting to repel the Russian occupier.\n\nOrdinary Ukrainian citizens are fighting to repel the aggressor as well. The whole world now admires the courage of our people, because each of us contributes to the victory of Ukraine.\n\nIn times of war, everyone must work in cohesion, in synergy and at full potential. This is what the enemy fears and is trying in every effort to prevent.\n\nBut it is not easy to intimidate us, it is not easy to distract our attention and concentration. Already 140,000 Ukrainians, mostly men, have returned back home to Ukraine. We are proud of these people. They stand ready not just to defend their homes, but also to work for the sake of victory.\n\nUkrainian companies are prepred and invite various specialists to work. There is job for everyone willing to help the country!\n\nFollowing the instruction of the President Volodymyr Zelenskyi, the Government has formed a package of decisions to support Ukrainian businesses during the war.\n\nFirst. We will introduce exemption of Natural Persons of the first and second groups from paying USC (Unified Social Contribution – ed.) under the martial law effect and during one year after it officially lifted.\n\nSecond, we will introduce exemption of enterprises and Natural Persons (Entrepreneurs) of the third group from paying USC for employees who were drafted into the Armed Forces and other armed formations (including territorial defense). The contribution is to be paid by the state.\n\nThird, we introduce the delay of tax repayment for each company unable to pay.\n\nFourth, the introduction of PTR (Payment Transaction Recorders – ed.) for all individual entrepreneurs will be postponed.\n\nFifth, the Government will abolish all measures of market and consumer supervision in all matters except price regulation and control of pricing. A moratorium on inspections of all types for business has already been established.\n\nAll the aforesaid decisions and a number of other additional decisions necessary to make this support package work either have already been adopted or will be endorsed by the authorities shortly.\n\nMoreover, the Government and local authorities engage in vigorous activities to undertake new measures to stabilize prices for essential good.\n\nThe Cabinet of Ministers has endorsed a decision allowing regional military administrations in synergy with the National Police and the State Service of Ukraine on Medicines and Drugs Control to monitor the prices of socially important food, medicine and fuel. Some entrepreneurs should not, however, seek to profit from warfare.\n\nAnother essential front in the work of the Government and local authorities in times of war is ensuring the proper functioning of critical infrastructure. In particular, of those infrastructure facilities supplying people with electricity, heat and water.\n\nIt was decided that 12 Ukrainian TPPs will now be able to receive gas from Naftogaz of Ukraine NJSC at a price of UAH 7 per cubic meter. This will enable the relevant companies to buy the necessary volumes of natural gas in order to continue steady operation and supply electricity to Ukrainian families, despite possible disruptions in the supply of coal products, which is just of paramount importance.\n\nIn the end I would like to thank the Ukrainian energy sector workers, who are now ensuring operation of a vital energy front for the whole country. You do wonders every day so that, where possible, Ukrainians stay with light, heat and gas. Every family is grateful to you for that!\n\n**Glory to the Ukrainian people!

We never wanted this war. But it was brought to us. We never dreamed of killing. But we have to knock out the enemy. From our land and from our lives.\n\nWe have to endure what no other European nation has seen in 80 years.\n\nAnd it is on our land that it is decided whether someone else in Europe will fall victim to the same aggression.\n\nI’m telling this to the leaders of the world and I hear that they agree.\n\nWe decide the future of the continent. WIth our resistance. And our friends - with their help.\n\nI spoke again with Polish President Andrzej Duda. They help us. Keep working.\n\nI spoke with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson and Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi. With President of France Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister of India Modi.\n\nI received very important signals, which, I'm sure, will only strengthen Ukraine.\n\nOur theses in conversations with partners are absolutely logical. They are fair. Honest.\n\nIf the invasion continues and Russia does not abandon its plans against Ukraine, then a new sanctions package is needed. New sanctions, new sanction steps against war and for peace.\n\nBoycott of Russian exports. In particular, the refusal of oil and petroleum products from Russia.\n\nThis can be called an embargo. Or just morality. When you refuse to give money to a terrorist. Boycott of imports to Russia. If they do not want to follow civilized rules, they should not receive goods and services from civilization. Let the war feed them.\n\nThe international community must act even more decisively.\n\nWhen someone loses their mind, we have to lose fear and forget about commerce. We need to defend ourselves.\n\nYou have to be moral. Both states and companies.\n\nWe must fight against the inhuman force that wants to destroy humanity itself.\n\nThe success of the Ukrainian army. The will of the Ukrainian people.The principled nature of international sanctions. This is the way to peace.\n\nAt night the invaders fired at Mykolaiv. Right at the residential areas. Using rocket artillery.\n\nThey fired at Kharkiv, at residential areas of a peaceful city.\n\nThey fired at other cities of our state.\n\nNo military sense. Just terror.\n\nResidents of Irpen, Bucha, Hostomel and many other towns and villages, which the invader managed to capture, are being held hostage. Temporarily. Until the invaders get punishment. And they will get it.\n\nOur Armed Forces know how to do it.\n\nThe enemy is tired. Demoralized. They came to our land to look for something that has never been here: cowardice, consent to slavery.\n\nAny normal person is afraid to look at burned houses. It is obvious. Destroyed panel high-rise buildings. Destroyed ordinary cars.\n\nMissiles, air bombs, \"Grads\", mortars. Against people.\n\nIt feels like it's in another country. But this is in our country. In ours, not somewhere else. In ours.\n\nWhich has always wanted peace above anything else.\n\nHow many more deaths and losses are needed to secure the sky over Ukraine?\n\nHow do civilians in Kharkiv or Mykolaiv differ from Hamburg or Vienna?\n\nWe are waiting for a decision. Securing the sky.\n\nEither with the power you have, or give us fighter jets and air defense systems that will provide us with the strength we need.\n\nThis is the help that the world should provide not just to Ukraine, but to itself. To prove: humanity will win. As soon as possible.\n\nThe Government of Ukraine is already working on how to restore our state after the victory.\n\nHow to give more strength to the country while we are fighting.\n\nA special package of assistance to businesses and employees has been created.\n\nSole proprietors of the first and second groups are completely exempt from UST.\n\nEnterprises and sole proprietors of the third group are exempt from paying UST for employees who were drafted into the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other defense formations. In particular, the territorial defense.\n\nExemption from land tax and rent for state and communal land in all areas where hostilities are taking place.\n\nAll this is during martial law and at least a year after its end.\n\nThe payment of taxes for all enterprises that are unable to pay them is postponed.\n\nAnd this is only the first part of a large aid package. Government support.\n\nAll leaders of the central government have a clear task: to develop a system of action so that the recovery of Ukraine is rapid and focused only on people. First of all - on people.\n\nFor us all to return to peace, to normal work. When we return our land, return peace to our land.\n\nI am grateful to all business owners and managers who continue to work and fulfill their obligations to their employees.\n\nTo pay salaries to people - even if the company does not work as before - is to protect Ukraine.\n\nThe state fulfills all its obligations.\n\nIndexed pensions have already been provided to the people. The salary in the budget sphere is paid as it should be.\n\nUkrainians!\n\nThere are millions of us. And these are millions of ways to fight for our future. For our state. For our freedom. For our national flag. Blue and yellow. Not a tricolor. We defend our flag because it is our worldview.\n\nUnder the blue and yellow we gained victories at the Olympics. We unfurled this flag both in space and in Antarctica.\n\nUnder our national flag, our rescuers, firefighters, peacekeepers, medics and everyone else came to the aid of Turkey, Greece, Israel and Georgia, Afghanistan and Montenegro, India, Italy, the Congo and many other countries.\n\nWhat we have never done under this flag is attacking other countries, seizing foreign lands, killing people, peaceful people of other nations.\n\nWe and terror are different universes.\n\nThat is why there is no blood on our flag. There are no and will never be black spots on it. There are no and will never be any swastikas on it. The Ukrainian flag is the land. Peaceful, fertile, golden and without tanks. This is the sky. Peaceful, clear, blue and without missiles. So it was. And so it will be.\n\nI believe!\n\nI know.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"The future of the continent is being decided by us with our resistance and by our friends with their help – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyi",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF1wKMZWM9w"},{id:"NCNcdXAo51Y",name:"A briefing by Iryna Vereshchuk",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Ірина Верещук"],date:"2022-03-07T10:36:39",topics:[],cities:[],text:"A briefing by Iryna Vereshchuk.

And the obligatory answer: "God forgives, and I forgive." These words seem to have lost their meaning today. At least in part. After everything we went through.\n\nWe will not forgive the destroyed houses. We will not forgive the missile that our air defense shot down over Okhmatdyt today. And more than five hundred other such missiles that hit our land. All over Ukraine. Hit our people and children.\n\nWe will not forgive the shooting of unarmed people.

Mutilated lives. They want to kill even more.\n\nTomorrow Russia has officially announced the shelling of our territory. Our enterprises. Defense complex. Most were built decades ago. By the Soviet government. Built in cities. And now they are in the middle of an ordinary urban environment. Thousands of people work there. Hundreds of thousands live nearby.\n\nThis is murder. Deliberate murder.\n\nAnd I have not heard a reaction from any world leader today. From any Western politician. Reaction to this announcement. Think about the sense of impunity of the invaders: they announce their planned atrocities. Why?\n\nBecause there is no reaction. Because there is silence. Not a word, as if Western leaders have dissolved tonight. For this day. I hope that at least tomorrow you will notice it. React. Say something. We know exactly who prepared this attack. We know exactly how orders will follow the vertical command. We know everything.\n\nAnd we will not forgive anything. The Tribunal is waiting for you. And God\'s judgment, if you try to hide.\n\nThe audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal to the West that sanctions against Russia are not enough. Because they didn\'t understand. Did not feel. They did not see that the world is really determined. Really determined to stop this war. You will not hide from this reality.\n\nYou will not hide from new murders in Ukraine.\n\nThere was a lot of talk about humanitarian corridors. There were talks every day about the opportunity for people to leave the cities where Russia came. Russian military.\n\nI am grateful to every Ukrainian who stays to defend our cities, even in the encirclement. Our freedom.\n\nBut I also know that there are people who really need to get out. Who cannot stay. And we heard the promise that there would be humanitarian corridors. But there are no humanitarian corridors.\n\nInstead of humanitarian corridors, they can only make bloody ones.\n\nA family was killed in Irpen today. A man, a woman and two children. Right on the road. As in the shooting club. When they were just trying to get out of town. To escape.\n\nThe whole family. How many such families have died in Ukraine! We will not forgive. We will not forget.\n\nWe will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war. On our land. We will find every bastard. Which shot at our cities, our people. Which bombed our land. Which launched rockets. Which gave the order and pressed "start".\n\nThere will be no quiet place on this earth for you.

Hundreds of international companies cease operation in Russia, close production, ban the sale of goods.\n\nAnd while Russia is suffering losses on all fronts, we must quickly transfer to the "Martial Law Economy" - to rebuild the efficient operation of all critical enterprises, mobilize resources, create new logistics.\n\nI appeal to the local authorities of those regions that are now in the home front! You are coping well with the challenge of accommodating evacuees. Now is the time to provide them with work.\n\nBefore the war, we altogether talked a lot about industrial parks. Now your solutions in this direction should be the basis for the deployment of enterprises that will work for the sake of our victory.\n\nI appeal to businesses! And to those who are now engage in vigorous activities. To those who at that time were evacuated to other regions. We also have a request to you. If you are not exposed to any danger, gather your employees and resume production! The state needs your help today more than ever!\n\nI appeal to Ukrainians! The war came as a shock to each of us. Many have lost their homes, jobs and savings. But they remained to defend Ukraine. Today the state will support you. On commission of the President of Ukraine, an updated ePidtrymka program will be launched next week. Under this initiative, every employee, every self-employed person whose job was taken away as a result of the war, will be able to receive UAH 6,500 each.\n\nThe program will function by analogy with vaccination payments - that is, through the Diia application. The Ministry of Digital Transformation will provide details on how to apply for assistance and receive the payment.\n\nIt\'s for now. But in the future, each of you must start working for the benefit of Ukraine and our victory. I am grateful to everyone who in one way or another helped our heroic army, as well as continues to help people who found themselves in difficult conditions of destruction and occupation. Now we must resume production where possible.\n\nWhat, for its part, is the Government doing to ensure a speedy conversion to a war economy?\n\nFirst. Financial support for the functioning of the state. We are negotiating financial assistance with all international organizations and countries. Among the recent decisions - the European Investment Bank will transfer EUR 639 million from other projects to the state budget of Ukraine. We have already endorsed the necessary documents within the Government.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has already issued and held an auction of first military government bonds. The second auction is soon to be conducted. Anyone who is willing to invest in Ukraine, our military, our doctors, critical infrastructure workers can do so by purchasing military government bonds.\n\nMoreover, as I told before, we are engaged in establishing the funds with the resources to be directed to restore Ukraine. The Government has already authorized the responsible ministries to open four accounts with the National Bank, to which funds from individuals, organizations, companies and international financial organizations will be credited.\n\nWe are talking about the Economic Recovery and Transformation Fund, the Affected Business Support Fund for small and mid-size entreprises. About the Destroyed Property and Infrastructure Restoration Fund. Here we are talking about homes, and apartments, and the housing that people have lost. In fact, this fund will also provide such compensation issues. As well as the Debt Management and Redemption Fund.\n\nSecond. Economy under the martial law envisages clear needs planning. The state has already begun to place government orders at enterprises to meet the most critical needs. It\'s not just about weapons. We are talking about food, medicines, fuel and other important goods.\n\nWe must provide Ukraine with everything it needs. The Government has already taken a decision to restrict the export of a number of socially important goods and raw materials for their production. Control over food security is currently one of the priorities of the Ministry of Economy.\n\nHence, let’s get to work!\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!

More than two hundred representatives of both parties of the Congress. They are very sincere.

And only repression will answer it.\n\nDo not be silent!\n\nThe Russian servicemen who were taken captive by our defenders started speaking. Hundreds and hundreds of prisoners.

At the maximum of possibilities. Every soldier on the lines of defense. Every doctor who saves lives. Every firefighter who extinguishes fire. Every entrepreneur who continues to work. Dozens and dozens of other professions. Millions of people, which became one whole. Superpower of the spirit.\n\nProgrammers who joined the information troops. Everyone who joined the territorial defense. Teachers and educators who do not leave children. Police officers. Civil servants. We all withstood the blow together. We will all rebuild our state together.\n\nWhat gives us this confidence? Where is it from? It's not just words. It's not just faith. This is our reality. Unconditional reality. Which is fueled by the energy of our people everyday. Our resistance. Our protest.\n\nKherson. Melitopol. Berdyansk. Konotop. The reality of all cities and towns, rural communities that expel the invaders everyday. By their determination. By their unity.\n\nFreedom Square in Kherson is the whole of Ukraine. The streets of Konotop, where locals are shouting at the invaders, are Ukraine.\n\nUkraine, which we know, love, protect and will not give up to any enemy.\n\nIt is a special heroism to protest when your city is occupied. Even temporarily. When you don't have a weapon and in response you receive gunshots. And you don't run. When you don't have armor and an armored personnel carrier is coming at you. And you do not move aside.\n\nThat is why the occupation is temporary! It is artificial.\n\nOur people, our Ukrainians do not retreat. Do not give up. Do not stop the resistance. They shout to the occupiers - go home. Like a Russian ship!\n\nThey drive them away from our territory. They block the roads for them. Every meter of our Ukrainian land won by protest and humiliation of the invaders is a step forward, a step towards victory for our entire state. This is a chance to live.\n\nUkrainians! In all our cities where the enemy entered. Feel it. Go on the offensive! You need to go outside! You have to fight! Every time when there is an opportunity. As in Kherson. As in Berdyansk. As in Melitopol. As in Konotop. You need to go out and drive this evil out of our cities. To prevent the creation of new DPR and LPR where normal life is simply impossible. Only slavery. Only on the knees.\n\nDonbas! Remember what they said about you: Nobody put Donbas on its knees! And no one will be able to do that! Everyone in Donetsk and Luhansk knows these words. They were often repeated. Earlier. What about today?\n\nDonbas, today is the time! We appeal to all people in the temporarily occupied territory. To all who hear us. Whose memory has not been erased by propaganda. Whose eyes have not been closed by fear. Whose soul has not been mutilated by cynicism.\n\nFight for your rights! For your freedom. For Ukraine. Together with Kherson. Together with Berdyansk. Together with Kyiv and all other Ukrainian cities that value life and are not afraid of anything.\n\nI know that many of you believed that Ukraine allegedly hates you.\n\nWill allegedly attack you. Will allegedly destroy you.\n\nLiars on Russian TV talk about it every day.\n\nLiars. It's their job to lie to you every day. But this should not be your destiny.\n\nJust compare Donetsk after 8 years of war and Kharkiv after 8 days of war.\n\nYou were told that we are destroying cities. Look at Kharkiv. At Chernihiv. At 500 kg bombs that were dropped on the houses of Ukrainians. They were killing us. They were killing children. Look at Borodyanka. Look at the destroyed schools. At the blown up kindergartens. At the damaged Kharkiv Assumption Cathedral. Look what Russia has done.\n\nIt did it right in front of your eyes. Protect yourself! Otherwise, it will take your life, too. Your houses. Ukraine does not shoot its people. We do not blow up residential buildings. And everyone in Donbas has always been and will be our people. Our citizens.\n\nIn Donetsk. Luhansk. Kherson. Berdyansk. Melitopol. Konotop. In all our cities. In all cities of our state. In Ukraine.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:'"Our people, our Ukrainians are not retreating. Do not give up.

Sincere faith. And round-the-clock work.\n\nThe tenth day is like one infinitely long day. One infinitely long night that does not allow us to have a rest.\n\nToday is Saturday. Saturday. This word means nothing during the war. Like Monday or Thursday or any other day. They all became the same.\n\nWe still protect the state. We still save people.\n\nThe country does not know weekends anymore. It doesn't matter what time it is. It doesn't matter what date it is. And it will be so until victory.\n\nLate at night I spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron. And with President of Poland Andrzej Duda. Our interaction is constant. Our conversations are daily. I am immensely grateful to each of them. I am immensely grateful to Andrzej for his determination and devotion to our common cause. Protection of people. I am grateful to Andrzej's wife - Agata. They are friends whom I sincerely consider friends and sincerely wish to everyone.\n\nWe managed to prevent a humanitarian crisis at the border. We managed to organize the situation so that thousands and thousands of Ukrainian women and children were treated decently. Nobody asks about their nationality, faith or how much money they have. In fact, we no longer have a border with Poland. Because we are together on the side of good. We do not have time for borders.\n\nI am sure that soon we will be able to tell our people: come back!\n\nCome back from Poland, Romania, Slovakia and all other countries.\n\nCome back, because there is no more threat.\n\nWe are already thinking about the future. For all Ukrainians. After the war. About how to revive our cities. How to revive the economy. I spoke with World Bank President David Malpass, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.\n\nWe have an agreement among the largest financial institutions to support Ukraine. There is already a decision on emergency aid and tens of billions of dollars for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war.\n\nAnd these are only the first decisions. I emphasize these are only the first. I spoke with Turkish President Erdoğan. I spoke with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. I spoke with President of the European Council Charles Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. The main topic is EU membership for Ukraine.\n\nI am grateful to Europeans - hundreds of thousands of people in different cities of our continent. Bratislava, Vilnius, Frankfurt, Lyon, Paris, Tbilisi, Prague. They came out yesterday in support of Ukraine. In support of Europe. They came out for peace to be reached as soon as possible.\n\nI am grateful to Americans for the unwavering bipartisan majority of ordinary people. We saw the poll. We saw the opinion of ordinary people in America who support ordinary people in Ukraine. Who demand tougher sanctions against Russia for aggression already now. Who support closing the sky now to save the lives of our people. 74 percent of Americans stand for the no-fly zone. 74! The vast majority. What else is needed to make a decision? We are sure that the result is similar in other democratic countries.\n\nThe Armed Forces of Ukraine bravely hold all key areas of our defense.\n\nThey are counterattacking the invaders near Kharkiv - defending the city. They are holding the line in Mykolaiv. Kyiv, Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Donbas. We inflict losses on the invaders they have not seen in their worst dreams.\n\nThe Russian army has not reached the planned frontiers. Yet it has reached almost 10 thousand Russian soldiers killed. 10 thousand. This is dreadful! 18-year-old, 20-year-old boys. Very young, almost children. Soldiers who were not even explained why they were going to fight. For what and why they are in a foreign land. \n\n10 thousand. Russia could definitely give these people something else. Instead of death.\n\nThe Ukrainian people are resisting even where the invaders managed to pass. Unfortunately. But not for long. I admire every Ukrainian who is not silent. Who protests. Who takes the national flag and shows the Russian military that they will lose. They will definitely lose. Because it is impossible to win against people who stop military equipment without weapons in their hands. Who refuse to take anything from the hands of the invaders. Whose situation is tough and dangerous. But they do not lose their dignity. And will never lose it.\n\nAt the talks in Belarus, the groups agreed on the first step. To bring back at least one percent of humanity from the normal level. Surrounded cities that are being destroyed and experiencing the worst days. Humanitarian corridors must work today. Mariupol and Volnovakha. To save people. Women, children, the elderly. To give food and medicine to those who remain. Our help is already on the way. Everyone who needs help should be able to leave. Those who are willing. Everyone who can defend their city must continue to fight. Must. Because if everyone leaves, then whose city will it be?\n\nWe are doing everything - on our part - to make the agreement work. This is one of the main tasks for today. Let's see if we can go further. In the negotiation process.\n\nLet’s pray for our military. Let’s help our civilians.\n\nLet’s work for peace.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"«I am sure that soon we will be able to tell our people: come back!

The Russian army and its top officials were telling about how they would discharge NATO forces into the English Channel in a week, while their soldiers now drop their equipment and surrender instead.\n\nFighting is taking place in dozens of cities and hundreds of villages, and everywhere the enemy is facing resistance not only from the military, but from the entire population as well.\n\nIn the agony of its own defeat, Russia resorts to increasingly criminal acts.\n\nBuildings, hospitals, schools and even maternity hospitals constantly come under aerial bombing.\n\nThe occupier kept fire nightlong from all the sides covering the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Energodar. The President of Ukraine urgently addressed the leaders of the G7 countries. I made an urgent call to the IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi and told that in the agony of fear, the enemy could cause the largest tragedy since the Chornobyl NPP accident.\n\nRadiation knows no boundaries. The possible area coverage is the whole world. Once again, I call on the international community, represented by the IAEA and the EU, to ensure the arrival of peacekeeping groups consisting of representatives of the EU, IAEA and SNRIU (State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine) at all five nuclear power plants in Ukraine. This is a matter of security for the whole world!\n\nThe UN Human Rights Council has taken a critical decision to set up a commission of inquiry to investigate Russia's crimes against Ukraine's civilian population. The more so the work of the International Criminal Court to investigate war crimes committed by Russian terrorist forces in Ukraine commences as well. This means that all those responsible for the deaths, especially of civilians, will be held accountable.\n\nNow I want to appeal to all Ukrainians!\n\nOur total resistance to the enemy must take place on all fronts. On the front lines, on the home front, in the territories temporarily occupied by the enemy. It is time for everyone to get a grip and think with calm mind where he or she can be most effective.\n\nIf you have the experience and desire - join the ranks of territorial defense. Help volunteers. Join the information attack on the enemy. Work at your company. Support each other. Find your place and make your contribution. The 40 million people united by the common idea of victory are impossible to stop and, most importantly, impossible to conquer.\n\nThe Government works 24/7.\n\nToday we have two main objectives. First – to satisfy of the needs of the AFU and other armed formations.\n\nSecond is the provision of the civilian population with essential goods even in those regions, that were now blocked through the hostilities or occupation, the organization of green corridors for the evacuation of the civilian population, the humanitarian assistance deliveries.\n\nYesterday I had a talk with the President of the Red Cross Peter Maurer. He assured me that the Red Cross would do everything possible to help evacuate Ukrainians, deliver food and medicine to places where hostilities are underway.\n\nToday, Ukrzaliznytsia has become a company that purchases food, fuel, medicine for the needs of the state and people affected by the war at the expense of state funds. By the recent decision of the Government, we have allocated UAH 18 billion for these purposes. Let me take this opportunity and thank the railway workers who, despite the risks, continue to perform their jobs and save people!\n\nUkrainians! Our only goal is to liberate Ukraine from Russian invaders.

A country of freedom. The people of absolute moral leadership.\n\nWe have endured nine days of darkness. Nine days of evil. This is three times more than darkness and evil expected.\n\nWe responded to the invasion as we can in times of greatest danger. Responded with heroism. Solidarity. Mutual assistance. We responded in Ukrainian. So that the history of Europe will remember it forever. It will tell children about it. Show it to grandchildren.\n\nThe whole continent will know the city of Kharkiv. The city of Chernihiv. The city of Sumy. The city of Volnovakha. The city of Mariupol. The city of Mykolaiv. And many other of our beautiful cities. Living cities! Cities that have withstood the worst invasion since World War II.\n\nI say this specifically as a fait accompli. Withstood. No matter what the situation is at the moment, strategically, everything is clear.\n\nUkrainians are united from Uzhhorod to Kharkiv, from Kyiv to Kherson. Ukrainians are chasing the enemy near Kyiv. They are beating him for Okhtyrka. Punishing him for Hostomel. They will take revenge for Kherson. Our Kherson! Ukrainian Kherson. Which they tried to humiliate today.\n\nThey failed. They were not allowed. Ukrainians have shown themselves.\n\nThey did not allow themselves to be deceived in a cheap cynical show. With a handout instead of help. With propaganda instead of sincerity.\n\nRussian propagandists thought of our people as of themselves. And they saw that Kherson residents are proud. And respect themselves. Respect Ukraine.\n\nI understand how difficult the decision is. When in the occupation they come out against armed enemies.\n\nI feel how risky it is.\n\nBut I see how our people refuse to play by the rules of the invaders. How our people remain Ukrainians. How our people stay with our state, even temporarily finding themselves in the darkness.\n\nIf Russian politicians still have their eyes, they will be able to see what Ukraine is. What our freedom is.\n\nThe invaders thought they could turn off our television to Ukrainians. Our connection. They thought they could take away products, shut off the electricity. They thought it would force Ukrainians to submit.\n\nBut even if you deprive us of oxygen, we will breathe deeply, to say: get out of our land!\n\nEven in complete darkness we see the truth.\n\nAnd we will fight until it darkens in our eyes.\n\nBecause we are the warriors of light. And today no one on Earth will be able to say that this line is pathos.\n\nThe 9th day of the war. Many of us have a tradition to remember those who are not with us on the 9th day.\n\nEternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine!\n\nUnfortunately, today there is a complete impression that it is time to give a funeral repast for something else:\n\nSecurity guarantees and promises.\n\nDetermination of alliances.\n\nValues that seem to be dead for someone.\n\nThe NATO summit took place today. Weak summit. Confused summit.\n\nSummit, which shows that not everyone considers the struggle for freedom to be Europe's number one goal.\n\nAll NATO intelligence offices are well aware of the enemy's plans. They also confirmed that Russia wants to continue the offensive. As best it can.\n\nFor 9 days we have seen a brutal war. They are destroying our cities. They are shelling our people, our children, and residential neighborhoods. Churches. Schools. They destroy everything that ensures a normal life. And they want to continue it.\n\nKnowing that new strikes and casualties are inevitable, NATO deliberately decided NOT to close the sky over Ukraine.\n\nWe believe that NATO countries themselves have created a narrative that the closure of the sky over Ukraine would provoke Russia's direct aggression against NATO.\n\nThis is self-hypnosis. Of those who are weak, underconfident. Internally. Although they may have weapons many times more powerful than ours.\n\nYou had to think about people. About humanity itself.\n\nAnd what did you think about at that summit?\n\nAll the people who will die starting from this day will also die because of you.\n\nBecause of your weakness. Because of your disunity.\n\nAll the Alliance has managed to do so far is to carry fifty tons of diesel fuel for Ukraine through its procurement system. Probably so that we can burn the Budapest Memorandum. To make it burn better.\n\nBut it is already burnt for us. In the fire of Russian troops.\n\nIs this NATO we wanted? Is this the Alliance you were building?\n\nToday, the Alliance's leadership gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities by refusing to make a no-fly zone.\n\nYou could close our sky. But…\n\nI do not know who you can protect and whether you can protect NATO countries.\n\nYou will not be able to buy us off with liters of fuel for liters of our blood. Shed for our common Europe. For our common freedom. For our common future.\n\nBut I am also grateful to our country's friends in NATO. There are many countries of our friends, our partners - most of the powerful partners. Those who help our state no matter what. From the first day of the invasion. And I'm sure, until the victory.\n\nAnd that's why we do NOT feel alone.\n\nWe continue to fight. We will protect our state. We will liberate our land.\n\nThanks to our heroes.\n\nI awarded decorations and medals to 76 Ukrainian heroes for personal courage and selfless actions for our defense. Unfortunately, 37 of them are awarded posthumously.\n\nI awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine to Lieutenant General Oleksandr Oleksiyovych Pavliuk, Commander of the Joint Forces Operation.\n\nI conferred the military rank of Brigadier General on Colonel Volodymyr Vasyliovych Shvorak, Deputy Commander of the East Operational Command of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nI conferred the military rank of Brigadier General of Justice on Colonel of Justice Serhiy Mykolayovych Melnyk, Head of the Military Law Institute of the Yaroslav the Wise National Law University.\n\nI conferred the military rank of Brigadier General on Colonel Artem Yevhenovych Bohomolov, Deputy Commander of the West Operational Command.\n\nI conferred the military rank of General on Valerii Fedorovych Zaluzhnyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"We responded to the invasion as we can in times of greatest danger.

History of Ukraine. History of Europe.\n\nRussian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The largest in Europe. It alone could be like six Chornobyls. Russian tankers knew what they were firing at. Direct aiming at the station. This is terror of an unprecedented level.\n\nThere are 15 nuclear units in Ukraine. And the Russian servicemen have completely forgotten about Chornobyl. About this world tragedy.\n\nRussian people, I want to address you. How is that even possible? Together in 1986 we struggled with the consequences of the Chornobyl disaster. You must remember the burning graphite scattered by the explosion. Victims. You must remember the glow above the destroyed power unit. You must remember the evacuation from Pripyat and the 30 km zone. How could you forget it? And if you have not forgotten, then you cannot be silent. You must tell your authorities, go to the streets and say that you want to live. To live on earth without radioactive contamination. Radiation does not know where the border of Russia is.\n\nAll night I was in touch with partners, with the leaders of other countries, so that the world could react. I felt that the world leaders were shocked. Britain is convening a UN Security Council over the attack. The IAEA is launching its 24-Hour Incident and Emergency Center. Immediate sanctions against the nuclear terrorist state are needed. Immediate closure of the sky over Ukraine is needed, because only this can guarantee that Russia will not strike at least missiles and air bombs at nuclear facilities.\n\nI am grateful to our heroes from the National Guard who guarded the station and tried to stop the enemy. I am grateful to the rescuers who extinguished the fire. But a lot depends on the common people of Energodar. You understand the threat to the station better than anyone else. You live there. Next to it. And you see the invaders directly. Drive them away. Let them know that Energodar is Ukraine. That Ukraine is not a place for nuclear ashes.\n\nUkrainians! The enemy has brought the vast majority of its troops into the territory of our state. Almost the entire Russian army is thrown against our people. But the heroic resistance of Ukrainians has been saving our country from this invasion for the ninth day. Ukrainian cities have not seen such inhuman cruelty since the Nazi occupation. Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Kharkiv, Mariupol. They are purposefully destroying civilian infrastructure. Destroying people. Residential neighborhoods. Just yesterday, Russian bombs killed 47 people in Chernihiv. Peaceful people. Kharkiv... Kharkiv is simply being destroyed by rocket artillery and air strikes. Russia. Destroys. Kharkiv. How could this happen? This morning in Zhytomyr, the rocket hit the school building. Hit children. This is the reality when “fraternal” Russia comes.\n\nYesterday, during talks in Belarus, we managed to agree on the creation of humanitarian corridors where people suffer the most. Today we will see whether the agreement works.\n\nOur defense inflicts maximum losses on the enemy. Almost 9,200 invaders were killed. As of the morning of the ninth day of the war. We beat them near Mykolaiv. We beat them near Kharkiv. We beat them near Kyiv. The capital remains a key target for the invaders. But they will not break us, they will not break our statehood. Never. No matter what they do, they will still lose. Because we are at home. We are on our own land.\n\nThey are constantly preparing provocations. A provocation is being prepared in Kherson. They are going to put up a performance of a kind of rally for Russia. To do this, they brought strangers to the city. They are looking for local traitors. They want to make a TV picture as if Kherson is no longer Ukrainian. I want to remind you that this is how they started the so-called "DPR" and "LPR". You understand what happened to them later. This must be stopped. Kherson residents, show that this is your city. You can stop everything, any plan of the invaders. Do not listen to anyone - listen to your children, listen to your heart. You are Ukrainians.\n\nI urge Kherson residents to get rid of any despair. Ukraine will not give up what is ours. We are fighting against a powerful enemy that outnumbers us. Which outnumbers us in the amount of equipment. But which is thousands of light years away from normal people who have dignity. Show it. Our national flag. Our national anthem. Our national spirit. Be sure to let the occupiers know that they can only be in Kherson temporarily. And they will never be able to own Kherson. Like any other city in Ukraine. Let the occupiers know that they can only stay in Kherson temporarily. And they will never be able to own your city, Kherson. Like any other Ukrainian city - the city of our state.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ',description:"«We have survived the night that could have stopped the history of Ukraine and Europe» address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyi",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKFyL9a3a5k"},{id:"95GZrpeeJmk",name:"Address by the President on regarding the shelling of the Energodar nuclear power plant",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-04T04:13:08",topics:["Атомна станція","Енергодар","Атомна загроза"],cities:["Чорнобиль","Запоріжжя"],text:"Address by the President on regarding the shelling of the Energodar nuclear power plant",description:"Address by the President on regarding the shelling of the Energodar nuclear power plant",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95GZrpeeJmk"},{id:"iGszxUWo_6A",name:"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi spoke with Western media",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-03T20:24:28",topics:[],cities:[],text:"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi spoke with Western media",description:"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi spoke with Western media",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGszxUWo_6A"},{id:"Okq2WNVfS_Y",name:"Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyi",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-03T10:56:28",topics:[],cities:[],text:"«They wanted to destroy us so many times.

The enemy's blitzkrieg failed.\n\nNo major regional cities have ever surrendered without a fight.\n\nNo one is giving a hospitable welcome to the invaders.\n\nUkraine is turning to total resistance. In cities, towns and villages, people are blocking columns of armour and vehicles, attacking supply trucks, and capturing Russian soldiers.\n\nThe information wave produced by Ukrainians has proliferated worldwide. And the whole world is on our side.\n\nWe can feel the support not just in words.\n\nThousands of volunteers from all over the world come to Ukraine to fight on the side of freedom.\n\nWe have already received tons of modern weapons from our partners.\n\nThe UN General Assembly unequivocally acknowledged that Russia had committed aggression against Ukraine and demanded that Russia ceases fire.\n\nThe world is helping us financially. Today, the Memorandum on EUR 1.2 billion macro-financial assistance from the European Union was signed. An agreement on the establishment of a multi-donor fund with the participation in particular of the World Bank to the tune of USD 1.8 billion will be signed in the coming hours. \n\nUkraine has also appealed to the international organizations, in particular the IAEA to immediately call on NATO to close access to the airspace over our nuclear facilities. Close the sky over Ukraine! Now it's a matter of security for the whole world! Not only for Ukraine!!!\n\nWe also appeal to the UN and the Red Cross.\n\nAfter the strikes on civilians, the whole world has seen that Russian troops are terrorists who are killing civilians and do not let anyone help the victims. In some cities, children, pregnant women, and the elderly are trapped by the enemy and have been living without electricity, heat, water, food, and medical care for days now. The invaders do not give safe routes for evacuation. Ukraine demands for the sake of people's lives and health to provide the ‘green corridors’ for us to provide assistance and evacuate everyone who either wishes or needs that!\n\nDespite the full-scale aggression by Russia, the entire life-supporting infrastructure of the state is working sustainably.\n\nAnd so is the Government.\n\nDespite the war, the Government, the Ministry of Social Policy, and the Pension Fund accrued all pensions with 14% adjustment in favour of all Ukrainians. Pensions have been accrued to 13 million people, and the funds have already been transferred to banks. Payments have already been started on schedule, and, for some categories, payments have been made even sooner.\n\nAlso, pursuant to the President's instruction, the Government has developed an assistance program for all Ukrainians who have lost their employment. Every employee, every self-employed person, every citizen of Ukraine who has lost his or her job due to the war and hostilities will unconditionally receive UAH 6’500 each during March. We will announce shortly how this money can be obtained.\n\nFollowing the Government decision, the Ukrainian Railways have started procuring fuel, medications, electricity and other important goods and services. The company will maintain close contact with the civil-military administrations to promptly cover the urgent needs of the people and the state.\n\nMost importantly, the truth is on our side, and we will never give up! Therefore, already now, in follow-up of the instruction of the President of Ukraine, the Government is now establishing 4 major funds. The financial resources from these funds will be spent to rebuild Ukraine.\n\nFirst – This will be the Destroyed Property and Infrastructure Restoration Fund. We will rebuild everything that has been destroyed by the Russian occupationists – every house, every apartment, every school, every kindergarden and hospital! Every bridge, and road!\n\nSecond – Economic Recovery and Transformation Fund. We will ask our partners to accept the so-called ‘Marshall Plan for Ukraine’. We need not just to rebuild the economy, but we will build a new European country.\n\nThird – Debt Management and Redemption Fund. Today, despite the war, Ukraine continuously fulfils all its commitments. On March 1, our Ministry of Finance made a coupon payment of USD 292 million on Eurobonds. But we believe that the world must help and support Ukraine given the heavy burden on us today.\n\nAnd fourth – Affected Business Support Fund. We all see how many entrepreneurs and companies help our military, doctors, and ordinary Ukrainians today. We are all united for a common goal – to chase off the enemy from our land. And we understand that our task is to help entrepreneurs return to normal business, normal life.\n\nWe are here, we are on our land, and no one will be able to take away our European future! We will rebuilt everything!\n\n**Glory to the Ukrainian Army! Glory to the Ukrainian People! Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"The situation regarding the Russian invasion - a briefing by the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denis Shmygal",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMOZOAQVD6Q"},{id:"owxfukITehs",name:"For us, this is a patriotic war, and we know how such wars end for the invaders",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-04T00:50:11",topics:["Громадянська відсіч","Міжнародні переговори","Призначення","Герої України"],cities:["Конотоп","Баштанка","Енергодар","Мелітополь","Волноваха","Чернігів","Київ"],text:"\nGood health to you, dear Ukrainians! Strong and kind! But – kind NOT to enemies.\n\nWe are a nation that broke the enemy's plans in a week. Plans that have been built for years. Treacherously. Deliberately. With hatred of our country, of our people - of any people who have heart and freedom. But we stopped them. We beat them. Our military, border guards, territorial defense. Even ordinary farmers capture the Russian military on a daily basis. And they all say one thing: they don't know why they're here. Despite the fact that their quantity is ten times bigger, the morale of the enemy is deteriorating. More and more invaders are fleeing back to Russia. From us. From you. From all who drive out the enemy with javelins, stugnas, guns, tanks, planes, helicopters. Everything that shoots.\n\nBut Ukrainians are beating the enemy even without weapons. I sincerely admire the heroic civilians of Konotop, Bashtanka, Energodar, Melitopol. Other towns and villages. Who do not let the invaders in by blocking the roads. People come out in front of enemy vehicles. This is extremely dangerous. But this is brave. It is also salvation. I'm sure you saw a video from Melitopol where Ukrainians protested against Russians who entered our city. Temporarily. I am sure of this: if they entered somewhere, it is only temporarily. We’ll drive them out. With shame. As those people, ordinary people who drive the invaders out of grocery stores when the Russian soldiers are trying to find food do. These are not warriors of the superpower. These are confused children who were used. Take them home.\n\nUkrainians! Every invader should know: they will not get anything here. No one will be conquered. Even if they can accumulate more equipment and more people, it doesn't change anything for them. Wherever they enter. They will be destroyed everywhere. They will not have peace. They will have no food. They will not have a single quiet moment. The invaders will receive only a rebuff from Ukrainians. Fierce rebuff. Such a rebuff that they will forever remember that we will not give up what’s ours. That they will remember what the patriotic war is. Yes, for us it is a patriotic war. We remember how patriotic wars begin. And we know how they end. For the invaders.\n\nOur army is doing everything to break the enemy completely. Almost nine thousand Russians were killed! In one week! In the Mykolaiv direction invaders have to take away the \"two hundred\" and \"three hundred\" with tens of helicopters. 19 years, 20 years ... What did they see in life, apart from this invasion? But most of them remain everywhere. Ukraine does not want to be covered with military corpses. Go home. Your whole army. Tell your commanders that you want to live. Not to die. To live. The war must be stopped and peace restored as soon as possible.\n\nToday was, as usual, an active day of negotiations with the leaders of the member states of our anti-war coalition. I held talks with the heads of government of Norway and Israel. With the President of Kazakhstan. With the Emir of Qatar **Tamim Bin Hamad al Thani**. With President of the European Council **Charles Michel**. With Prime Minister of Canada **Justin Trudeau**. With President of Poland *Andrzej Duda**. Brilliant result at the UN General Assembly. 141 countries supported the resolution, which calls on Russia to withdraw troops from Ukraine immediately. 141 states stand for us! And for Russia - only four states that voted against. Here is the list: North Korea, Eritrea, Syria and Belarus. This is the list. These are the friends. And there will be no others for the state that does not know how to live in peace.\n\nToday I held a meeting with the heads of regions and cities of Ukraine. The new head of the Odesa regional state administration is already working. Maksym Marchenko. Military. Professional. Our guys on the ground are working hard to organize \"green corridors\". To take out civilians. To bring medicine. Volnovakha, cities of the Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv regions, south of Ukraine. This is very difficult. Extremely difficult. We are opposed by terror. But terror loses. Thanks to our heroes.\n\nToday I signed a decree awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to fifteen of our defenders:\n\n**Senior Lieutenant Maksym Vitaliyovych Bilokon**. Posthumously. He took part in repelling the enemy's attack during the defense of Chernihiv, destroyed the enemy's subversive group and two enemy tanks.\n\n**Lieutenant Colonel Oleksandr Valeriyovych Kapichun**. Posthumously. Thanks to his heroic actions, the enemy column was stopped, equipment and enemy soldiers were destroyed.\n\n**Soldier Oleksandr Volodymyrovych Lukyanovych**. Posthumously. During the battle he neutralized up to three dozen units of enemy equipment. He was fatally wounded by an air strike.\n\n**Junior Sergeant Mykhailo Mykhailovych Nesolyony**. Posthumously. He died in close combat with enemy forces while evacuating people.\n\n**Soldier Andriy Valeriyovych Nikonchuk**. Posthumously. He protected the Kyiv HPP from Russian air raids and missile strikes.\n\n**Lieutenant Vitalii Romanoviyh Sapyl**. Posthumously. Tank platoon commander. Neutralized three dozen enemy vehicles. Killed by an air strike.\n\n**Chief Sergeant Oleksiy Oleksandrovych Senyuk**. Posthumously. He defended Chernihiv, destroyed two enemy IFVs and captured a T-72 tank. Killed by an air strike.\n\n**Lieutenant Vladyslav Petrovych Ukrainets**. Posthumously. He covered the retreat of brothers-in-arms when the enemy attacked.\n\n**Major Stepan Ivanovych Choban**. Posthumously. The pilot of the Su-27, distracted the enemy aircraft over Kropyvnytskyi.\n\n**Major Ihor Vasyliovych Mykhalchuk**. Head of the tank battalion unit. Destroyed numerous enemy armored vehicles.\n\n**Colonel Serhiy Mykolayovych Musienko**. Head of the Missile and Artillery Division. Inflicted devastating blows on the enemy in the Kharkiv direction.\n\n**Lieutenant Yevhen Mykhailovych Palchenko**. Tank platoon commander. Covered the exit of the brigade from the encirclement.\n\n**Major Vladyslav Yuriyovych Prokopenko**. Head of the tank battalion. Withdrew personnel and equipment from the encirclement without loss.\n\n**Lieutenant Colonel Pavlo Yuriyovych Fedosenko**. Head of the unit of the 92nd brigade. For the effective defense of Kharkiv.\n\n**Senior Lieutenant Dmytro Petrovych Chavalakh**. For heroic participation in the defense of the Kherson region.\n\nAll 40 million are like these fifteen heroes!\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"«Every invader should know: they will not get anything here.

I did not accidentally say \"united\". The seventh day of this terrible war began. A war we feel the same way. During this time we have had more unity than for over thirty years before. At first we were equally scared, then we felt equally painful. And now we do not care. Except for victory. Except for the truth. Except for peace. Except for the tranquility we want to achieve. Except for the lives of our people, for whom we are worried. Except for Ukraine. During this time, we have truly become one. We forgave each other a lot. We started loving each other. We help each other. We are worried for each other. Yesterday morning on Freedom Square we were all Kharkiv residents. Then the enemy destroyed us all by striking at residential buildings in Borodyanka. We were all bombed in Kyiv last night. And we all died again in Babyn Yar - from a missile strike. Although the whole world promises constantly - never again.\n\nFor any normal person who knows history, Babyn Yar is a special part of Kyiv. A special part of Europe. A place of prayer. A place of remembrance for the hundred thousand people killed by the Nazis. The place of old Kyiv cemeteries. Who should you be to make it a target for missiles? You are killing Holocaust victims for the second time. During the Soviet era, a TV center was built on the bones there. And also a sports complex. Outbuildings. They built a park there. To erase the true history of Babyn Yar. But why was it bombed? This is beyond humanity. Such a missile strike shows that for many people in Russia, our Kyiv is completely foreign. They know nothing about our capital. About our history. But they have an order to erase our history. Erase our country. Erase us all. On the first day of the war, Uman was brutally bombed, where hundreds of thousands of Jews come every year to pray. Then - Babyn Yar, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were executed. I am now addressing all the Jews of the world - don't you see what is happening? That is why it is very important that millions of Jews around the world do not remain silent right now. Nazism is born in silence. So shout about the killings of civilians. Shout about the killings of Ukrainians.\n\nLast night and tonight they continued to bomb our cities. Bombs. Missiles. Artillery. Machine guns. Targeting peaceful people. Again. Targeting residential areas. Again. Mariupol, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Zhytomyr and other cities and towns of Ukraine. This cannot be explained by any human reason. Any reason of God. What then, if Babyn Yar was attacked? What other military facilities threaten Russia? What other “NATO bases”? Saint Sophia Cathedral? Lavra? St. Andrew's Church? Whatever they dream of there - damn them! Because God is with us!\n\nDuring this time, we have united the European Union already on a new level. Higher than formal. Higher than interstate. At the level of ordinary people. Millions and millions of Europeans. From the Atlantic Ocean to the suburbs of Kharkiv, where fierce fighting continues. When the European Parliament stood and applauded us, our struggle, it was an assessment of our efforts. Our unity. Six days of war like thirty years. That is why the European Union answers \"yes\" to us. We have started a special accelerated accession procedure. Our diplomats and our friends unite the world for the sake of Ukraine and peace even more. Neutral Switzerland has supported EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs, officials, the state and companies. Once again: neutral Switzerland! So what do some other countries expect? Our anti-war coalition has already been joined by the countries that Moscow relied on a week ago. This is an extraordinary result. You can't stay neutral right now!\n\nAnd what is the result for Russia? The flag of this state will no longer be seen in sports tournaments. Modern world culture will now be closed to them. Russian goods are being removed from store shelves around the world. Russian banks are disconnected from the global system. Russian citizens are losing their savings, losing all prospects. Russian mothers are losing their children in a completely foreign country. Think of this number: almost six thousand Russians died. Russian military. In six days of war. This is without counting the losses of the enemy last night. Six thousand. To get what? Get Ukraine? It is impossible. This is not to be changed by missiles. Bombs. Tanks. Any blows. We are on our native land. And for the war against us there will be an International Tribunal for them.\n\nUkrainians! Another night of Russia's full-scale war against us, against the people, has passed. Hard night. Someone spent that night in the subway - in a shelter. Someone spent it in the basement. Someone was luckier and slept at home. Others were sheltered by friends and relatives. We’ve hardly slept for seven nights. Or we sleep, but anxiously. My dears, the time will come when we will be able to sleep. But it will be after the war. After the victory. In a peaceful country, as we need. Which we have always appreciated. And which we have never destroyed. I ask all of you to take care of your loved ones. Take care of your brothers-in-arms. I admire you! The whole world admires you. From Hollywood stars to politicians. Today you, Ukrainians, are a symbol of invincibility. A symbol that people in any country can become the best people on earth at any moment.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n",description:"Address by the President: Ukrainians are a symbol of invincibility",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVRZNGFXF0Y"},{id:"UgacKdlj6HQ",name:"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi gave an interview to CNN and Reuters",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-03-01T22:15:56",text:"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi gave an interview to CNN and Reuters",description:"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi gave an interview to CNN and Reuters",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgacKdlj6HQ"},{id:"FdovXexNqnM",name:"The enemy attacked the capital! 5 peaceful citizens of Kyiv were killed",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Віталій Кличко"],date:"2022-03-01T22:15:56",text:"Vitalii Klychko: The enemy attacked the capital! 5 peaceful citizens of Kyiv were killed",description:"Vitalii Klychko: The enemy attacked the capital! 5 peaceful citizens of Kyiv were killed",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdovXexNqnM"},{id:"eEJc4ospS44",name:"We are preparing to defend Kyiv",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Віталій Кличко"],date:"2022-03-01T22:15:56",text:"Vitali Klitschko: The situation is difficult.

A cruise missile strike. At the largest square of Europe. Freedom Square. Dozens of victims. This is what the price of freedom is. This is what the morning of the people of Ukraine is.\n\nUkrainian Kharkiv and Russian Belgorod have always been close cities. In many ways. Even the border between them was only conditional, only on maps, but not in the soul. Not in the soul. Now everything has changed. After the cruise missile that struck Kharkiv from Belgorod. The missile that hit Freedom Square. The face of our Kharkiv. This is terror against the city. There was no military target on the square. Just as in those residential areas of Kharkiv hit by rocket artillery. The rocket aimed at the central square is an outright, undisguised terror. No one will forgive. No one will forget.\n\nThis attack on Kharkiv is a war crime. This is state terrorism of the Russian Federation. After that, Russia is a terrorist state. Obviously. And it must be official. We call on all countries of the world to respond immediately and effectively to this criminal tactic of the aggressor and to declare that Russia is committing state terrorism. We demand full responsibility for terrorists in international courts.\n\nKharkiv and Kyiv are currently the most important targets for Russia. Terror is meant to break us. To break our resistance. They are heading to our capital, as well as to Kharkiv. Therefore, the defense of the capital today is the key priority for the state. All cities of Ukraine must do everything to stop the enemy. The military and civilian authorities of each city are responsible for this. But Kyiv is special. If we protect Kyiv, we will protect the state. This is the heart of our country. And it must keep beating. And it will keep beating. So that life triumphs.\n\nDear Kyiv residents! Defense of the capital is above all. That's why I decided to appoint a professional military person as the Head of the Kyiv City Military Administration for the period of war. To guarantee the defense of the city. To block the enemy's approaches to our capital. To ensure that the people of Kyiv have everything they need. The Head of the Military Administration will be General Mykola Mykolayovych Zhyrnov, who served as commander of the support forces. At a high level he organized the engineering support of combat operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2014-2015. He is currently a state expert of the Military Security Service at the National Security and Defense Council. Vitali Klitschko remains mayor of Kyiv. He will have his own sphere of responsibility. And now it is a joint work of the mayor and the Head of the Military Administration. After the war, we will return everything to its place in the capital.\n\nRegarding our diplomats. Right now, our diplomats are implementing fair and absolutely necessary decisions in relation to those states that have betrayed their word and international law. We immediately recall the Ambassador from Kyrgyzstan for consultations. For justifying aggression against Ukraine. We immediately recall the Ambassador from Georgia. For the obstacles to volunteers who want to help us. For an immoral attitude towards sanctions.\n\nAnd now I want to speak about those whose feat is an example of the highest moral strength. These are our doctors. You save people around the clock. Always. And now your work is one of the key lines of our defense. You keep it brilliant. Thousands of lives have been saved in 5 days. I am also grateful to everyone who provides our people with everything they need for life in these extremely difficult conditions. Food, energy, medicine. And I thank the ordinary people of Ukraine, who stop tanks with their bare hands, expel the invaders from administrative buildings by force of spirit and make their stay in Ukraine shameful. To prove that they are all strangers here. This is what the people's war is. This is what the people of Ukraine is.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"The missile at the central square of Kharkiv is terrorism, and Russia must be held accountable for this in international courts - Address by the President of Ukraine.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opcPsPcaPOA"},{id:"ZbrSG0CMXak",name:"Address by the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-02-28T23:40:40",topics:["Ракетний удар","Воєнний злочин","Оборона Києва","Відкликання дипломатів","Приєднання до ЄС"],cities:["Харків","Київ"],text:"\nRussian forces today brutally shelled Kharkiv with rocket artillery. This is definitely a military crime. A peaceful city. Peaceful residential areas. No military object. Dozens of eyewitness records prove that this is not a separate false shot, it is a conscious destruction of people. Russians knew where they were shooting.\n\nFor this crime there will definitely be a tribunal. International. This is a breach of all conventions. No one in the world will forgive you the murder of peaceful Ukrainian people. Here is Ukraine. Here is Europe. Here is 2022. Evil, armed with rockets, bombs and artillery, must be stopped immediately. Destroyed economically. We must show that humanity is able to protect themselves. I believe that it is necessary to consider the full closure of the sky for Russian missiles, airplanes, helicopters. In five days of invasion, already 56 missile strikes have been carried out against Ukraine. 113 cruise missiles were fired. This is their \"fraternal friendship\". And the world knows what to do. I spoke about this with partners today.\n\nThe state committing military crimes against civilians cannot be a member of the UN Security Council. The entrance to all ports, channels, airports in the world must be closed for this state . Such a state must not receive hundreds of billions for energy exports. Buying Russian goods now is to pay money for murdering people.\n\nPeaceful, proud, strong Kharkiv. You have always been such. You will always be such. We will withstand this as well. We will defend Ukraine. We will help everyone affected by inhuman invasion. Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Sumy, Hostomel, Vasylkiv, Kherson, Mariupol, Donetsk and all other cities and towns of our native country will see a peaceful and safe life. Sincere condolences to all who lost their relatives and loved ones in this war. Eternal memory to those who died. Eternal glory to everyone who defends our freedom!\n\nBefore addressing you, I signed a decree on awarding the title of the Hero of Ukraine to twelve our defenders:\n\n* **Lieutenant Colonel Eduard Mykolayovych Vahorovsky** (posthumously). He died saving our aircraft from a missile strike. Gave others the opportunity to take to the air. \n* **Major Dmytro Valeriyovych Kolomiets** (posthumously). He rescued his brothers-in-arms, diverted enemy aircraft fire and was shot down by an enemy plane.\n* **Lieutenant Colonel Hennadiy Vasyliovych Matulyak** (posthumously). Hostomel. Destroyed the group of enemy equipment.\n* **Lieutenant Vitaliy Anatoliyovych Movchan** (posthumously). In an air battle he destroyed two enemy aircraft.\n* **Colonel Oleksandr Yakovych Oksanchenko** (posthumously). He died in an air battle, distracting enemy aircraft.\n* **Senior Lieutenant Vyacheslav Denysovych Radionov** (posthumously). Thanks to his courageous actions, the entire crew of the brigade's planes took to the air in Vasylkiv, and this saved ours from a missile strike.\n* **Senior Lieutenant Andriy Andriyovych Gerus**. Over the city of Kropyvnytskyi he shot down an enemy IL-76, which prevented the landing of Russian troops with weapons.\n* **Brigadier General Dmytro Serhiyovych Krasylnykov**, Commander of the Operational and Tactical Group \"North\". For two days he has been fighting off the continuous assault, saved people and equipment. And did not let the enemy into Kharkiv from the Luhansk region.\n* **Lieutenant Colonel Andriy Mykolayovych Kruhlov**. He withdrew the Buk SAM unit from the enemy attacks and personally destroyed two Russian helicopters and one plane.\n* **Colonel Oleksandr Volodymyrovych Mostov**. He shot down a Russian IL-76 near Vasylkiv, as well as two Mi-24 helicopters, which prevented the landing of paratroopers and weapons.\n* **Lieutenant General Yuri Ivanovych Sodol**. In the battles for Volnovakha, he saved our men from the encirclement and organized a successful counterattack. He brought people out of the enemy’s attack. Defends Mariupol extremely effectively.\n* **Colonel of medical service Eduard Mykolayovych Khoroshun**. He personally organized the defense of the besieged military medical center and carried out the evacuation of the wounded.\n\nNow about Kyiv, our beautiful capital, the basis of our state, our security. For an enemy, Kyiv is the key target. They want to break our national statehood. Therefore, the capital is constantly in danger. Three rocket-bombing strikes are carried out only today. TETs-6 is the target. They want to damage a power station and leave our city without light. We did not allow them to break the defense of the capital. And they send saboteurs to us. Constantly. Hundreds. All they are being neutralized.\n\nIn addition to defense, we are thinking about the rear as well. Provide people with everything necessary. We formed a round-the-clock coordination headquarters that collects all requests from regional administrations regarding the lack of the most necessary stuff. Products, medicines, fuel, equipment. The headquarters directly  finds suppliers that can quickly and qualitatively meet such needs. This is the restoration of supply chains, interrupted by the war.\n\nToday, at the initiative of the Russian side, the first round of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia took place. These negotiations took place against the background of bombing and shelling of our territory, our cities. Synchronization of shelling with a negotiation process could be seen. I believe that Russia is trying to put pressure on us in such a way. Don't waste time. We do not perceive such tactics. Fair negotiations are possible when one side does not hit the other side with rocket artillery precisely at the moment of negotiations.\n\nSo far we do not have the result we would like to get. Russia has declared its position. We have outlined positions in response - to end the war. Some signals we received. When the delegation returns to Kyiv, we will analyze what we’ve heard and then determine how to move to the second round of negotiations.\n\nAnother thing that is very important to say. We've been waiting 30 years for this. Today I signed an application for Ukraine's membership in the European Union. We have gained the right to be together with everyone in Europe. The application has already been delivered to Brussels, officially registered.

While our troops bravely defend the Ukrainian land from the invasion of the occupiers, civilian Ukrainians and the Ukrainian state began to work hard in a mode – ‘all for the frontline, all for victory’\n\nPrivate businesses provide free-of-charge fuel, medications, food, and equipment for the troops. The courage and valour of our military inspire all Ukrainians to contribute as much as they can to our victory. People cook food for the fighters, weave camouflage nets and set up checkpoints.\n\nThe Government also continues to work tirelessly. Today, at an ad-hoc Government meeting, we made the following decisions.\n\nToday, pursuant to the instruction of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi, the Government has decided that, for the time of martial law, all the servicemen will be paid an additional remuneration of UAH 30’000 per month.\n\nAll the servicemen who see action and are direct parties of combat mission or involved in national security and defence operations will be rewarded with an increased monthly remuneration of UAH 100’000.\n\nMoreover, families of the fallen servicemen will be paid a one-time compensation in the amount of UAH 15 million.\n\nThese decisions remain valid since February 24 this year – the day when the Russian Federation brought about a full-scale war against Ukraine.\n\nThe Cabinet of Ministers has also significantly expanded the list of critical imports. It was supplemented by meat and edible offal, milk and dairy products, vegetables, nuts, coffee, tea, cereals, wheat flour, juices, fats and oils, sugar and confectionery. The list also includes a number of defence goods.\n\nA 24/7 Coordination Centre for food, medicine, drinking water and fuel supplies has been set up to provide war-affected municipalities and regions with everything they need.\n\nDuring the martial law period, the Cabinet of Ministers facilitated and simplified the procurement procedures for goods, works and services required for the Ukraine's defence and for ensuring livelihood of the population and functioning of the state. The procurement procedures will be initiated by the leaders of contracting entities or the bodies managing state property assets.\n\nThat is how our nation is hardened.\n\nThe whole world is now talking about Ukraine. People all over the planet gather in streets and squares wearing blue and yellow colours of our flag and shout ‘Glory to Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to heroes! Hands off Ukraine!’.\n\nWe are grateful to our friends all over the world for the assistance they have been providing to Ukraine – defence, humanitarian, and economic.\n\nWe are grateful for the sanctions you are imposing on Russia.\n\nWe are appreciative of the support rallies that are taking place all around the world.\n\nWe are thankful for the closed sky for Russian planes.\n\nAnd more, Ukraine has appealed to the European Union to join immediately under a special procedure. We, all the Ukrainian people, will be grateful for the positive decision!\n\nFellow Ukrainians, keep holding the line! We continue to work as hard as we can for our victory!\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!

The fifth day of Russia's full-scale war against the people of Ukraine. We stand firm. During this time, we have experienced as much as other nations may not have in decades. We have been told for a long time that there is something wrong with Ukrainians in this or that issue. That Ukrainians have to do so-called \"homework\" for decades. Because of this, we often did not notice what we are really capable of. And now we have shown ourselves to the fullest. And it's inspiring. For everyone.\n\nIn every conversation with our partners, I hear sincere respect. Ukrainians have shown the world who we are. And Russia has shown what it has become. Just think about it: during the Russian invasion - in just four days - sixteen Ukrainian children died as a result of the Russian shelling. Sixteen! 45 children were wounded.\n\nEvery crime, every shelling that the invaders commit against us, unites us and our partners even more. Russia did not believe in such a solidary and powerful reaction. But Ukrainians have changed that story. The European Union has decided to supply us with weapons. We are grateful. Yesterday I spoke with Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, about further, even stronger steps. Europeans are aware that our soldiers are fighting for our country and, consequently, for the whole of Europe. For peace for all European countries, for the lives of children, for equality, for democracy. And this gives us the full right to do the following.\n\nWe appeal to the European Union for Ukraine's immediate accession under a new special procedure. We are grateful to our partners for being with us. But our goal is to be with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be equal. I am confident that is fair. I am confident we deserve it. I am confident that all this is possible.\n\nYesterday I spoke with the Presidents of Portugal, Lithuania, President of France Emmanuel Macron and President of Poland Andrzej Duda. I am especially grateful to Andrzej Duda for our fruitful work. I spoke with the Prime Ministers of Belgium, Spain and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. Support of our anti-war coalition is unconditional and unprecedented.\n\nEurope has closed the sky to all Russian planes. Global business refuses any ties with Russian companies. Let's see how this week will end for the Russian currency - what will be the fall of the ruble. As long as this criminal invasion of Ukraine continues, the Russian state is suffering losses as if the war passed through their territory. Do you need all this? Russian mothers, Russian teachers, Russian entrepreneurs, ordinary people. For what?\n\nFour and a half thousand Russian soldiers have already been killed. Why did you all come here? Why do the columns of your armored vehicles go against us? From our Crimea. From Yalta, Yevpatoriya, Sudak, Simferopol... These are not the names of military camps for tankers. Once again: four and a half thousand Russian invaders killed. Throw away your equipment. And leave. Do not believe your commanders. Do not believe your propagandists. Just save your lives. Leave.\n\nWe dedicate every hour to strengthening our state. Anyone who can join the fight against the invaders must do so. Therefore, a decision was made - not easy from a moral point of view, but useful from the point of view of our protection. Under martial law, participants in hostilities - Ukrainians with real combat experience - will be released from custody and will be able to compensate for their guilt in the hottest spots of war. All sanctions are lifted from some people who took part in the anti-terrorist operation. The key now is defense.\n\nWhen I ran for presidency, I said that each of us is the President. Because we are all responsible for our state. For our beautiful Ukraine. And now it turns out that each of us is a warrior. The warrior in his or her own place. And I am confident that each of us will win.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Stand firm: Address by the President of Ukraine",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRwkk2mgfnU"},{id:"dA5f9CXh5bY",name:"Briefing by Oleksii Arestovych, Adviser to the Head of the President's Office",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Олексій Арестович"],date:"2022-02-27T23:49:59",text:"Briefing by Oleksii Arestovych, Adviser to the Head of the President's Office",description:"Briefing by Oleksii Arestovych, Adviser to the Head of the President's Office",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA5f9CXh5bY"},{id:"BeidqIRfLhE",name:"Volodymyr Zelenskyi told about the phone call to Oleksandr Lukashenko",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-02-27T18:45:12",topics:["Перемовини","Білорусь"],cities:[],text:'\nI had a phone conversation with Alexander Lukashenko. We haven\'t spoken to him in two years. And today I had a long substantive conversation with him.\n\nI explained to him in detail the impossibility of our clash. I do not want missiles, planes, helicopters to fly to Ukraine from Belarus. I do not want troops to go to Ukraine from Belarus. And he assured me of that.\n\nMy task as President is to protect our state. And you have seen during these tough days how we are fulfilling this task.\n\nAlexander Lukashenko called on the meeting of the Ukrainian and Russian delegations on the Pripyat River. I emphasize: without any conditions.\n\nI will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as President, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance.\n\nAnd while our guys are there, the President is here, the Head of the Office is here, the Prime Minister is here, the army is here, the Commander-in-Chief is here. We will all defend our state and our borders.\n\nYou and I must act pragmatically to achieve our goal. And our goal is our territorial integrity. You have seen our position one hundred percent. This is the unconditional protection of national statehood.\n\nAs regards our motivation. It is obvious that our servicemen are fighting not for money, but for today, for tomorrow. And they provide a very tough response to what happened yesterday.\n\nBut we must understand that today the most important job is to be a soldier, to defend the country. And that\'s why I really want the state to pay decently for this job.\n\nWe will pay our armed servicemen a hundred thousand hryvnias a month. Not to hear "thank you" from them, but to let them know that the country is definitely grateful to them. And it will be so until this war is over.\n\nAnd the last thing. Yesterday, unfortunately, we lost our "Mriya". But the old "Mriya". And we are building a new one now.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ',description:"I do not want missiles, planes, helicopters to fly to Ukraine from Belarus.

What do they do? This is revenge. The people rose to defend their state, and they showed their true faces. This is terror.\n\nThey are going to bomb our Ukrainian cities even more. They are going to kill our children even more insidiously. This is an evil that has come to our land and must be destroyed.\n\nThey lied that they would not touch the civilian population. But since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.\n\nThey consciously chose tactics to destroy people and everything that makes life just normal. Power plants, hospitals, kindergartens, residential buildings - all this is under attack every day.\n\nWhat the invaders are doing to Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, Kyiv, Odesa and other cities and towns deserves an international tribunal. We clearly record all their crimes. And there would have been many more of these crimes if it hadn't been for our courageous defenders.\n\nUkrainian forces are great. Repulse attacks, breaking the enemy's plans. They do their job brilliantly.\n\nYes, this is truly a job. A hard, fundamental, and most importantly - fair job. A job that deserves the highest appraisal and the highest gratitude. A decision was made to significantly increase the payments to our defenders. I can honestly say that it will be expensive. But there is nothing more precious than life and the struggle for our freedom and freedom of our next generations.\n\nAnd there are those who will help us. This is already real. We get weapons, medicine, food, diesel, money. A strong international coalition in support of Ukraine has been formed. An anti-war coalition.\n\nHere is the latest summary from the diplomatic frontline. There were very substantive talks with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the President of Georgia, the Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Johnson. Each conversation added specifics to the defense capabilities of our state and the strength of our military.\n\nGermany has announced the supply of 1,000 anti-tank grenade launchers and 500 Stingers with additional ammunition. Belgium provides 5,000 machine guns and 5 million rounds of ammunition, and another 4,000 tons of fuel.\n\nThanks to active diplomacy, we’ve convinced all European countries to disconnect Russia from SWIFT. We thank President of Poland Andrzej Duda for his personal leadership in granting Ukraine membership in the European Union. Poland's daily assistance to our country is also very much needed.\n\nWe have to call a spade a spade. Russia's criminal actions against Ukraine show signs of genocide. I talked about this with the UN Secretary General. Russia is on the path of evil. The world must deprive Russia of the right to vote in the UN Security Council.\n\nUkrainians! We know exactly what we are defending. We will definitely win.\n\n**Glory to each of our soldiers!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"What the invaders are doing to Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, Kyiv, Odesa and other cities and towns deserves an international tribunal.

This could look like a normal political process. But now it certainly cannot be anything normal.\n\nNow decisions are made on a completely different level.\n\nLast night in Ukraine was cruel. More shelling. More bombing of residential areas, civilian infrastructure. Today there is not a single object in the country that the invaders would not consider a valid target for themselves. They fight against everyone. They fight against everything that’s alive - against kindergartens, against residential buildings and even against ambulances. They use rocket artillery, missiles against entire urban areas in which there has never been any military infrastructure.\n\nVasylkiv, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and many other cities of Ukraine are surviving in conditions that were last seen on our land and your land during the Second World War.\n\nBut in the war that is going on now, you are not on the same side with us. Regretfully. From your territory, the troops of the Russian Federation launch rockets into Ukraine. Our children are being killed from your territory, our houses are being destroyed, they are trying to blow up everything that has been built over decades - and, by the way, not only by us, but also by our fathers, our grandfathers.\n\nAnd all this is also a de facto referendum for you, Belarusians. You decide who you are. You decide who to be. How will you look into the eyes of your children, how will you look into the eyes of each other, your neighbors. And we are your neighbors. We, Ukrainians. Be Belarus, not Russia! You are making this choice right now. Exactly today.\n\nNow there is a lot of news about possible negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, which can end this war and restore peace to all of us. And they often mention your capital. Minsk. As a platform for these negotiations. A place we didn't choose. And, in fact, you did not, too.The leadership of Russia chose it. And now, there is an offer to meet there again.\n\nFour days ago, cruise missiles, planes, helicopters and equipment came from Belarusian territory. They hit our homes, they hit our lives. The heavy equipment followed. And this is a dreadful deja vu. You know, Kyiv was attacked at 4 am. Someone has such a sense of humor, just as in 1941. You slept, Belarusian brothers. And we woke up. But you are still sleeping. And we haven't gone to bed since that moment. Because we are fighting. We are fighting for our country. We are fighting for our freedom. Because we have every right to do so.\n\nIf there were no aggressive actions from your territory, we could speak in Minsk. In your city. When you were neutral, we spoke in Minsk, we met many times. This is right. This is truthful. To talk like neighbors. Right now, you haven't made your big choice yet. And it is ahead, it should depend only on you. Not on Russia, not on Ukraine, not on America, but on the people of Belarus.\n\nThat is why now we say - not Minsk. The venue for the meeting may be other cities. Of course, we want peace. We want to meet, we want the end of the war! Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, Istanbul, Baku - we proposed to the Russian side all of this. Any other city suits us in a country from whose territory missiles are not launched. Only in this way can negotiations be honest. And they can really end the war.\n\nI sincerely wish Belarus to once again become that kind, safe Belarus that everyone saw not so long ago. Make the right choice. I am sure this is the main choice of your great people.\n    ",description:"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi addressed the citizens of Belarus",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwkFfesUFxY"},{id:"7ZHUyOBpQi4",name:"Briefing of the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denis Shmygal",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Денис Шмигаль"],date:"2022-02-26T21:11:24",topics:["Міжнародна допомога","Дії уряду"],cities:[],text:"\n**Heroic people of Ukraine!**\n\nFor more than 2 days now, our troops have been destroying the occupiers on land, at sea and in the sky. \n\nThousands of Russian soldiers were killed, and hundreds were taken prisoner. \n\nOur army is defending all parts of the frontline. The enemy had expected a cakewalk, but, instead, ended up in a real hell. \n\nUkraine is rising! Tens of thousands of volunteers, reservists and territorial defense fighters have already joined the defense of our land. \n\nThe Russian leadership does not understand that it is at war not only with the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but with the whole Ukrainian nation. And this nation has already risen to the liberation war against the occupiers. \n\nThe enemy has never achieved its goal, and, therefore, began shelling peaceful population and civilian infrastructure. They shoot at kindergartens, hospitals, and households; they shoot down ambulances and buses with children. The Russian command must appear before the tribunal for these crimes!\n\nThe enemy must definitely be punished for killing Ukrainian children! UKRAINE WILL NEVER FORGIVE!\n\nWe stay in Kyiv and continue to work hard. An extraordinary meeting of the Government has taken place today, and a number of important decisions have been made.\n\nFirst! Ensuring sustained operation of food producers under conditions of martial law. The maximum billing time for socially significant domestic food products will be no more than ten calendar days from the invoice date submitted by the suppliers.\n\nSecond! According to the recently passed order, the State Reserve Agency is required to provide sufficient diesel fuel supplies for the needs of the military.\n\nThird! An ordinance on the transfer of property confiscated by a court order and the State Customs Service to the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was adopted.\n\nFourth! We have established the procedure to coordinate humanitarian aid supplies and their further delivery to the Ukrainians. The State Border Guard Service and the State Customs Service shall secure a simplified border-crossing regime for humanitarian aid vehicles. For their part, the civil-military administrations, together with the National Guard, National Police and State Emergency Service, will ensure acceptance, distribution, and warehousing of humanitarian aid. \n\nIt has to be reminded that yesterday we adopted Resolution 5155 ‘On Recognition of Humanitarian Aid as Goods Required for National Security and Defense’. According to this resolution, for the time while martial law is enforced, the territorial defense leadership will have the right to decide on varieties of goods and humanitarian aid required for national security and defense. Such shipments will be allowed to cross the state border of Ukraine immediately.\n\nFifth! We have adopted a resolution on payment and delivery of pensions and cash aid for the period of martial law. Whenever any people find themselves unable to receive the money in their communities, or if it is not possible to wire it to the specified account, the pensions and cash aid will be handled through money orders. The Ministry of Social Policy, together with the Pension Fund and other bodies, will contact the recipients through personal e-accounts of the Pension Fund to actualize their place of residence.\n\nAnd the sixth! The government has decided to temporarily close all the BCPs across the state border of Ukraine with Russia and Belarus. And now, one very important point!!! Citizens of Ukraine who are still in those countries and want to come back home will be able to enter Ukraine. Come back and prove that you stand up for the good!\n\nI want to appeal once again to all civilized countries. It is time to choose your side! Are you on the side of child killers, or you are on the side of a great European nation that protects its freedom and its country from the aggressor? Give Ukraine defense weapons!!! Help us with equipment and materiel! Isolate Russia in all areas where possible! And we will continue to defend our country in the meantime. \n\nWe thank our friends from Poland, Latvia, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, the U.S., the United Kingdom, and other countries who have already sent and continue to send us weapons.

We withstood and successfully repel enemy attacks. The fighting continues. In many cities and districts of our state. But we know what we are defending. The country, the land, the future of children.\n\nKyiv and key cities around the capital are controlled by our army. The invaders wanted to block the center of our state and put their puppets here, as in Donetsk. We broke their plan. They did not gain any advantage over us.\n\nOn our streets, in the skies of Kyiv, in Vasylkiv, in Vyshhorod, even in the surrounding fields, a real battle for Kyiv took place. The enemy used everything against us: missiles, fighter aircraft, drones, artillery, armored vehicles, saboteurs, paratroopers. The invaders are shelling residential neighborhoods, including with the use of missile artillery, trying to destroy energy facilities. They have very treacherous tactics.\n\nDwellings destroyed by missiles and artillery are the ultimate argument for the world to stop the occupation invasion together with us.\n\nI say this as frankly as possible now: the people of Ukraine have already earned and have the right to become a member of the European Union. This will be the key evidence of our country's support.\n\nIt is a crucial moment to close the long-standing strategic discussion once and for all and to decide on Ukraine's membership in the European Union. I discussed this today with Charles Michel, Ursula von der Leyen, Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe anti-war coalition is operating - defense weapons and equipment are heading to Ukraine. We already have almost full support from EU countries for disconnecting Russia from SWIFT. I hope that Germany and Hungary will have the courage to support this decision. We have the courage to defend our homeland, to defend Europe.\n\nIn each of our cities, the invaders are being severely rebuffed. Uman, Odesa, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Donbas, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv - wherever the enemy kills our people, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing everything to stop and destroy the invaders. Lviv and other cities in western and central Ukraine that are under air attacks endure firmly. Well done!\n\nEvery Ukrainian needs to remember one thing. If you can stop and destroy the invaders, do it. All those who can return to Ukraine, come back to defend Ukraine. And then we will have a lot of work with you to rebuild it!\n\nAll those who can defend Ukraine abroad, do it purposefully, unitedly, continuously! All friends of Ukraine who want to join the defense - come, we will give you weapons! All the details of how to implement this will be announced in the near future.\n\nGlory to all those who defend Ukraine today! You are heroes!\n\nI adopted a decision to posthumously award the title of Hero of Ukraine to Vitaliy Volodymyrovych Skakun, a sapper of the 35th Separate Marine Brigade. At the cost of his own life, he blew up the bridge.\n\nAnd now I want absolutely everyone in Russia to hear me. Thousands of victims. Hundreds of prisoners who simply cannot understand why they were sent to Ukraine. Sent to be killed. The sooner you tell your government that the war must be stopped immediately, the more of your people will remain alive.\n\nWe see that there are indeed protests by your citizens against the war. We know that many in Russia are now simply shocked by the meanness and cruelty of the authorities. This is a truly correct response. I thank you for this reaction. Thanks to Leonid Parfyonov, Dmitry Muratov, Yury Dud, Liya Akhedzhakova, Valery Meladze and thousands, thousands of other Russians whose conscience is heard loud.

We are fighting for our state absolutely on all frontlines: South, East, North, in many cities of our beautiful country. Fighting around the clock on the diplomatic frontline as well - it\'s easier to say with whom I did not speak to among world leaders today. We continue this. I have been constantly working and spoke with President Macron, Scholz, Rutte, Mrs. von der Leyen, President of the United States Biden. I outlined what answer Ukrainians still expect from the West to this aggression and agreed on new assistance, new support, significant assistance for our state. I thank all the leaders and I am separately grateful to President Biden.\n\nI was really glad to see the news from friendly Georgia. I want to thank the good, beautiful Georgian people who went out on the streets of their country and supported Ukraine. You are true friends! Thanks.\n\nOur main goal is to end this slaughter. The enemy suffers very-very serious losses. These are hundreds, hundreds of killed soldiers who crossed our border, who came to our land.\n\nWe suffer losses as well, unfortunately. Ukrainians resist the aggression heroically. It is impossible to justify. Therefore, the invaders have to come up with more and more absurd accusations to say at least something.\n\nI am convinced that these allegations are biased, nobody will believe them. Ukrainians won’t believe them, the world won’t believe them, citizens of the Russian Federation won’t believe them.\n\nIt\'s simply cannot be such a truth that could clarify why kindergartens and housing infrastructure are fired from a missile artillery. In Vorzel, Kyiv region, they fired "Grads" at an orphanage. Okhtyrka, Sumy region, was shelled by "Uragans". Housing quarters, shelter, kindergartens were under the shelling. What is this war against Ukrainian children in a kindergarten? Who are they? Are they neo-Nazis from kindergarten as well? Or were they NATO soldiers that threatened Russia? Killed and injured children are the sentence to this invasion.\n\nEveryone, I emphasize, everyone must do everything they can to stop this war. Every day of aggression destroys normal life not only in Ukraine, but also in Russia, and in Europe, in the world.\n\nEuropeans do not imagine yet what it is like to live when there is such a confrontation next to you. I have to say absolutely frankly: this night will be harder than a day. Many cities of our state are under attack. Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, our boys, our girls in Donbas, cities of the south of Ukraine. Kyiv requires special attention. We cannot lose the capital.\n\nI appeal to our defenders on all frontlines. This night the enemy will use all the forces available to break our resistance. Treacherously, viciously, inhumanly. This night they will make an assault upon us. We all have to understand what we are going to face. This night we have to withstand. The fate of Ukraine is now being decided. Each civilian should be as careful as possible. Help, please, each other, especially elderly people, lonely, those for whom it is very difficult now. In case of any danger go to the shelter.\n\nEveryone who has already joined the country\'s defense or can help defend, stop the enemy everywhere you can. Remove special signs that saboteurs leave on the roads and buildings. Burn the enemy’s equipment with anything you can. If even kindergartens are a permissible target for invaders, you must not leave them any chance.\n\nAll thoughts, all prayers of Ukrainians are with our military. We believe in them, take care of them. Defend our state. The night will be tough, very tough. But the morning will come.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ',description:"Today was a hard yet courageous day.

For 1.5 days now, the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting the occupier on all fronts. With their heroism, our military has forever engraved their names in the world history of fame and bravery.\n\nOn all fronts, the enemy suffers heavy losses and this is only the beginning, if aggressor does not retreat immediately.\n\nTens of thousands of Ukrainians join the ranks of territorial defence.\n\nOur economy is turning to the format of \"everything for the front - everything for the victory\". You, fellow citizens, should turn yourself to the same format of work.\n\nJoin the ranks of the Armed Forces and the Defence Forces, help the military, help volunteers and medical community.\n\nThis is our homeland and we must do everything to protect its sovereignty and freedom.\n\nWe held an extraordinary meeting of the Government today. We took several decisions necessary to support the army, stable functioning of hospitals and critical infrastructure during military time in connection with Russia's aggression against Ukraine.\n\nFirst. Due to the martial law, the State Treasury Service, together with the Ministry of Finance, will redistribute funds to finance the strengthening of national security and defence, urgent measures under the martial law and payments.\n\nSecond. The Government has decided to make state domestic borrowings of up to UAH 400 billion through the gradual issuance of military bonds.\n\nThird. In connection with the imposition of martial law, we have approved additional types of financial support for the military.\n\nFourth. The Government has decided that the funds received by Ukrainians from the state for vaccination under the President's program ePidtrymka can be used to help the army. The money can either be transferred to help Ukrainian military to the International Charitable Foundation Come Back Alive or be credited to a special account of the National Bank, opened to raise funds for the army.\n\nFifth. Ports of Ukraine are under increased protection. The Cabinet of Ministers has established the level 3 of protection in sea and river ports of Ukraine, port facilities, vessels that have the right to sail under the State Flag of Ukraine for the period of martial law.\n\nSixth. By the decision of the Government for the period of martial law, the leaders of the territorial defence zone have the right to decide independently what humanitarian aid and what amount of it is needed. The State Customs Service and Border Guards must ensure the immediate clearance of such assistance to be delivered to hospitals, the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Territorial Defence Forces.\n\nSeventh. We are introducing a temporary suspension of blood exports. The Ministry of Health will also approve the scope of mandatory provision of the healthcare system with donated blood and blood products.\n\nAnd more. I want to address our international partners.\n\nThere are core moments for each nation, which become a part of history textbooks aftermath. Moments when you must decide - to swallow the actions of the aggressor or to repel them. And now it is such a moment.\n\nThe moment when Europe, the U.S and the whole civilized world must unite and stop the aggressor and his war against Ukraine. We call on all civilized countries to impose an embargo on oil products from Russia, to ban Russian citizens from entering your territory, to disconnect Russia from the SWIFT system.\n\nWe call on NATO, Europe, the United States - close the skies over Ukraine. This won’t mean your military confrontation with Russia. This means that you stop the war and your descendants will remember you as heroes.\n\nWe, in turn, will continue to defend our own land. We won’t give up and will continue to destroy our enemies. We are holding the line.\n\n**Glory to the Ukrainian army!**\n\n**Glory to the Ukrainian people!

And it's true. But this is not the whole truth.\n\nThis is not just Russia's invasion in Ukraine, this is the beginning of the war against Europe. Against the unity of Europe. Against elementary human rights in Europe. Against all coexistence rules on the continent. Against the fact that European states refuse to divide, yes, to divide the borders by force.\n\nThe cities of Ukraine undergo rocket bombing for the second day already. Tank columns and air strikes are as similar as something Europe has already seen a long time ago - during the Second World War and talked \"never again\" about it. But this is it! Again. Now. In 2022. 75 years after the Second World War completion.\n\nI’m confident you see it - all of you, entire Europe. But we do not see in full what you are going to do. How are you going to protect yourself when you help us so slowly in Ukraine?\n\nI’d like to point out what has already happened. And for this we are grateful. Sectoral sanctions. The United States, Canada, United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand introduced precisely sectoral sanctions against Russia. In particular, against all the largest banks. Against the largest Russian enterprises. Against Russia's access to Western technologies.\n\nBut Russian tanks are still shooting at residential buildings in our cities. Armored vehicles are still attacking, including civilians. Ordinary citizens of Ukraine.\n\nEurope has sufficient force to stop this aggression. What to expect from European states further?\n\nCancellation of visas for Russians? Cutting off Swift? Full isolation of Russia? Recalling ambassadors? Oil embargo? Closure of the sky? Today, all this should be on the table, because it is a threat to us, all of us, all of Europe. You can still stop aggression. We must act without delay.\n\nOrdinary people can also do their part of the job, I'm sure, in every country of the world, in each country of Europe. Go out on the square of your cities and demand peace for Europe, peace for Ukraine, stop this war. Go out, go out on the squares and demand to stop the war. This is our right. This is your right.\n\nWhen bombs fall in Kyiv, this happens in Europe, not only in Ukraine. When missiles kill our people, it's the death of all Europeans. Require more protection for Europe, more protection for Ukraine - as part of a democratic world.\n\nWhile state institutions in Europe are in no hurry with really strong decisions, every European in the capital can already come to our embassy and offer assistance. Demand from your governments more financial, more military assistance to Ukraine. For this help is a help to you. For it is a help to Europe. You help yourself.\n\nIf you have a combat experience in Europe and do not want to look at the indecision of politicians, you can arrive in our state and protect Europe with us where it is now urgently required.\n\nYou have already been blackmailed with gas. Already humiliated. They already want to split and divide you the same way as they are trying to divide Ukraine today.\n\nProtect yourself. Just as we protect yourself.\n\nI want to address Russian Federation President once again. Battles take place all over the territory of Ukraine. Let's sit at the negotiating table. To stop the death of people.\n\nAnd now I want to address the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Stand firmly. You are all we have. You are everything that protects our state.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"This is not just Russia's invasion in Ukraine, this is the beginning of the war against Europe.",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zFAZ4ezNYE"},{id:"zYAsviOQZ3g",name:"Briefing of Mykhailo Podoliak and Oleksiy Arestovych on the situation in Ukraine",translated:!1,russianTimestamp:"",speaker:["Михайло Подоляк","Олексій Арестович"],date:"2022-02-25T10:07:27",text:"Briefing of Mykhailo Podoliak and Oleksiy Arestovych on the situation in Ukraine",description:"Briefing of Mykhailo Podoliak and Oleksiy Arestovych on the situation in Ukraine",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYAsviOQZ3g"},{id:"07i3e0ouFNw",name:"Address by the President on the second morning of the large-scale war",translated:!0,russianTimestamp:"https://youtu.be/07i3e0ouFNw?t=209",speaker:["Володимир Зеленський"],date:"2022-02-25T08:53:00",topics:["Втрати серед цивільних","Ракетний удар"],cities:["Київ"],text:"\nThe second morning of a large-scale war. At 4 am, Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine.\n\nThey say that civilian objects are not a target for them. This is a lie. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas to operate.\n\nJust as yesterday, the military and civilians are equally under Russian attack. The purpose of this attack is to put pressure on you, the citizens of Ukraine, to put pressure on our entire society. I emphasize: not just on the government - on all Ukrainians. And today - even more than yesterday.\n\nOur men and women - all defenders of Ukraine - did not allow the enemy to realize the operational plan of invasion on the first day. Ukrainians demonstrate real heroism. The enemy was stopped in most directions. There are fights.\n\nTherefore, Russia's attack continues with the expectation that our forces will be tired. But no one is tired.\n\nUkraine's air defense forces are protecting our sky. As much as possible. Enemy aircraft operate treacherously over residential areas, including the capital.\n\nTerrible explosions in the morning sky over Kyiv, bombing, hitting a house, fire - all this reminds of the first such attack on our capital, which took place in 1941.\n\nThis morning we are defending our state alone, as we did yesterday. The world's most powerful forces are watching from afar.\n\nDid yesterday's sanctions convince Russia? We hear in our sky and see on our earth that this is not enough. Foreign troops are still trying to become more active in our territory.\n\nOnly the solidarity and determination of Ukrainians can preserve our freedom and protect the state. The army, border guards, the National Guard, the police, intelligence, the Territorial Defense Forces - everyone performs their tasks to the maximum.\n\nIt is very important that today our citizens also demonstrate maximum endurance and mutual support. Take care of your family and loved ones, but do not forget about the people around you. Those who are single, those who are older. Help them with food. Help find shelter when there is an air alarm. Help with access to verified official information.\n\nStop the enemy wherever you see it. The fate of Ukraine depends only on Ukrainians. No one but ourselves will control our lives. We are on our land, the truth is on our side. It will not be possible to destroy our character. Kalibr missiles are helpless against our freedom.\n\nRussia will still have to talk to us sooner or later. Talk about how to end the fighting and stop this invasion. The sooner the conversation begins, the smaller Russia's losses will be.\n\nDear citizens of the Russian Federation. As I said, tonight they started bombing residential areas of the hero city of Kyiv. It all reminds me of 1941. To all the citizens of the Russian Federation who come out to protest, I want to say - we see you. This means that you heard us. This means that you begin to trust us. Fight for us. Fight against the war.\n\n**Dear citizens of Ukraine.**\n\n**We are defending ourselves!

You are brilliantly defending the country from one of the most powerful countries in the world.\n\nToday Russia attacked the entire territory of our state. And today our defenders have done a lot. They defended almost the entire territory of Ukraine, which suffered direct blows. They regain the one that the enemy managed to occupy. For example, Hostomel near Kyiv. This gives more confidence to the capital.\n\nAccording to preliminary data, unfortunately, we have lost 137 of our heroes today - our citizens. 10 of them are officers. 316 are wounded.\n\nOn our Zmiinyi Island, defending it to the last, all the border guards died heroically. But did not give up. All of them will be posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine.\n\nMay the memory of those who gave their lives for Ukraine live forever.\n\nI am grateful to everyone who saves people right now and helps maintain order in the state.\n\nThe enemy strikes not only at military facilities, as it claims, but also at civilians. They kill people and turn peaceful cities into military targets. This is vile and will never be forgiven.\n\nI know that a lot of fakes are being produced now. In particular, that I allegedly left Kyiv. I stay in the capital, I stay with my people. During the day, I held dozens of international talks, directly managed our country. And I will stay in the capital. My family is also in Ukraine. My children are also in Ukraine. My family is not traitors. They are the citizens of Ukraine. But I have no right to say where they are now.\n\nAccording to our information, the enemy marked me as the number one target. My family is the number two target. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the Head of State.\n\nWe also have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv. That's why I am asking Kyivites very much: be careful, follow the rules of curfew. I remain in the government quarter together with all those who are necessary for the work of the central government.\n\nNo matter how many conversations I had with the leaders of different countries today, I heard a few things. The first is that we are supported. And I am grateful to each state that helps Ukraine concretely, not just in words.\n\nBut there is another - we are left alone in defense of our state. Who is ready to fight with us? Honestly - I do not see such. Who is ready to guarantee Ukraine's accession to NATO? Honestly, everyone is afraid.\n\nToday we heard from Moscow that they still want to talk. They want to talk about Ukraine's neutral status.\n\nI tell all the partners of our state: now is an important moment - the fate of our country is being decided. I ask them: are you with us? They answer that they are with us. But they are not ready to take us to the Alliance.\n\nToday, I asked the twenty-seven leaders of Europe whether Ukraine will be in NATO. I asked directly. Everyone is afraid. They do not answer.\n\nAnd we are not afraid of anything. We are not afraid to defend our state. We are not afraid of Russia. We are not afraid to talk to Russia. We are not afraid to say everything about security guarantees for our state. We are not afraid to talk about neutral status. We are not in NATO now. But the main thing - what security guarantees will we have? And what specific countries will give them?\n\nWe need to talk about the end of this invasion. We need to talk about a ceasefire.\n\nBut now the fate of the country depends entirely on our army, on our heroes, our security forces, all our defenders. And on our people, your wisdom and the great support of all friends of our country.\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"Today Russia attacked the entire territory of our state.

It's not just rocket explosions, battles, the roar of aircraft. It is the sound of a new Iron Curtain lowering and closing Russia away from the civilized world. Our national task is to make this curtain pass not through our Ukrainian territory, but at the home of Russians.\n\nThe Ukrainian army, our border guards, police and special services stopped the enemy's attacks. In the language of conflict, this can be called an operational pause.\n\nIn Donbas, our Armed Forces are doing great, the Kharkiv direction is very difficult, the forces for the defense of the city are working, they are reliable, they are our men. The most problematic situation today is in the south. Our troops are fighting fierce battles in the suburbs of Kherson. The enemy is pushing out of the occupied Crimea, trying to advance towards Melitopol.\n\nIn the north of the country, the enemy is slowly advancing in the Chernihiv region, but there are forces to hold it. Reliable defense is built in the Zhytomyr region. Enemy paratroopers in Hostomel are blocked, troops are ordered to destroy them.\n\nYes, we, unfortunately, have losses, losses of our heroes.

I would very much like you to speak on Red Square or somewhere else on the streets of your capital, in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia. Not only in Instagram - it is very important.\n\nWhat do we see at this hour? For the world community, Russia is becoming an analogue of the so-called DPR - this is complete isolation.\n\nI am in constant contact with the leaders of partner countries and international organizations. Russia has already begun receiving the first sanctions from a large package of sanctions, the most powerful in world history.\n\nNo one will be able to convince or force us, Ukrainians, to give up our freedom, our independence, our sovereignty. But it seems that the Russian leadership is trying to do this by destroying the potential of their country. Everything that Russia has done since 2000 can now be burned live in front of the world.\n\nWe emphasize that Ukraine did not choose the path of war. But Ukraine offers to return to peace.\n\nWhat can Ukrainians do? Help the national defense. Join the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and territorial defense units. Any citizen with combat experience will now be useful. It is up to you and all of us whether the enemy will be able to advance further into the territory of our independent state. Please help the volunteer community and the medical system, for example by donating blood.\n\nPoliticians and community leaders - help people, ensure normal life on the ground as much as possible. Everyone should take care of their loved ones and take care of those neighbors or acquaintances who need it. The duty of journalists, an important duty, is to defend democracy and freedom in Ukraine.\n\nI spoke today with many leaders - the United Kingdom, Turkey, France, Germany, the EU, the United States, Sweden, Romania, Poland, Austria and others.\n\nIf you, dear European leaders, dear world leaders, leaders of the free world, do not help us today, then tomorrow the war will knock on your door.\n\n**Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine!**\n\n**Glory to Ukraine!**\n    ",description:"It's not just rocket explosions, battles, the roar of aircraft.

This is not the first time. \n\nThe war against us is being systematically waged on all fronts. On the military one, they increase the contingent around the border. On the diplomatic one, they are trying to deprive us of the right to determine our own foreign policy course. On the energy one, they limit the supply of gas, electricity and coal. On the information one, they seek to spread panic among citizens and investors through the media.\n\nBut our state today is stronger than ever.\n\nThis is not the first threat that the strong Ukrainian people have faced. Two years ago, we, like the rest of the world, looked confused in the eyes of the pandemic. However, we united and with clear systemic steps practically defeated it. In this difficult time, the strong Ukrainian people have shown their best qualities - unity and the will to win.\n\nUnlike the pandemic two years ago, today we clearly understand all the challenges we face and what to do about them. We are confident, but not self-confident. We understand all the risks. We are constantly monitoring the situation, working out different scenarios, preparing decent responses to all possible aggressive actions.\n\nWe know exactly where the foreign army is near our borders, its numbers, its locations, its equipment and its plans.\n\nWe have something to respond with. We have a great army. Our guys have unique combat experience and modern weapons. This is an army many times stronger than eight years ago.\n\nAlong with the army, Ukrainian diplomacy is at the forefront of defending our interests. We have managed to gain diplomatic support from almost all leaders of the civilized world. Most of them have either already visited and supported Ukraine, or will do so in the near future. Today, everyone recognizes that the security of Europe and the entire continent depends on Ukraine and its army.\n\nWe want peace and we want to resolve all issues exclusively through negotiations. Both Donbas and Crimea will return to Ukraine. Exclusively through diplomacy. We do not encroach on what’s not ours, but we will not give up our land.\n\nWe are confident in our Armed Forces, but our military must also feel our support, our cohesion and our unity. The foothold of our army is the confidence of their own people and a strong economy.\n\nWe have formed sufficient reserves to repel attacks on the hryvnia exchange rate and our financial system. We will not ignore any industry that will need government support. As it happened the other day with airlines. And evidence of this is a stable hryvnia exchange rate and open skies.\n\nAn important front of defense is the objective coverage of the situation by the domestic media. And now I want to address our Ukrainian journalists. Some of you sometimes have to perform the tasks of media owners. Most of them have already fled their own country.\n\nWork for Ukraine, not for those who fled. The fate of the country today depends on your honest position.\n\nAnd now I want to address not those who stayed with Ukraine and in Ukraine, but those who left it at the most crucial moment. Your strength is not in your money and planes, but in the civic position you can show. Return to your people and the country due to which you got your factories and wealth. Today, everyone passes a real test for a citizen of Ukraine. Pass it with dignity. Let everyone understand for whom Ukraine is really the Homeland, and for whom it is just a platform for money making.\n\nI address separately all representatives of the state: civil servants, people's deputies of all levels who have fled the country or plan to do so. The people of Ukraine have entrusted you not only to govern the state, but also to protect it. It is your direct duty in this situation to be with us, with the Ukrainian people. I urge you to return to your homeland within 24 hours and stand side by side with the Ukrainian army, diplomacy and people!\n\nWe are told that February 16 will be the day of the attack. We will make it the Day of Unity. The relevant decree has already been signed. On this day, we will hoist national flags, put on blue and yellow ribbons and show the world our unity.\n\nWe have one great European aspiration. We want freedom and are ready to fight for it. 14,000 defenders and civilians killed in this war are watching us from the sky. And we will not betray their memory.\n\nWe all want to live happily, and happiness loves the strong ones. We have never known what it is to give up and we are not going to learn that.\n\nToday is not just Valentine's Day. It is the day of those in love with Ukraine. We believe in our own strength and continue to build our future together. Because we are united by love for Ukraine, united and unique. And love will win. Yes, now you may think it's darkness all around. But tomorrow the sun will rise again over our peaceful sky.\n\n**Love Ukraine!**\n\n**We are calm! We are strong! We are together!**\n\n**Great people of a great country.**\n    ",description:"Our state today is stronger than ever.
